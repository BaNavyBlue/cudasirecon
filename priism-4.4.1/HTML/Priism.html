<H1><A NAME="Priism">PRIISM</A></H1>
<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>Priism is a graphical interface to a collection of applications for
the analysis and visualization of multidimensional data with a focus on
data from 3D optical microscopy and electron tomography.

<P>Priism consists of three parts: the <A HREF="#UserInterface">graphical
interface</A> for starting applications; <A HREF="Monitor.html">the graphics
windows</A> in which images of data are displayed; and the separate applications
that operate on those windows or on disk files. For more information on
the applications, consult the list of applications by <A HREF="ApplicationCategories.html">category</A>
or by <A HREF="Applications.html">name</A>.

<P>Many parts of Priism can be customized.  The default attributes for
the image windows can be changed by selecting
<EM><A HREF="Preferences.html">Preferences</A></EM> from the <EM>File</EM>
menu.  The applications that appear in the Priism and image window menu bar can
also be customized:  look at the files CONFIG/IVE_NEW_FUNC_LIST and
CONFIG/MON_NEW_FUNC_LIST if you want to add or remove applications.

<P><A HREF="#ProgrammingInterfaces">Programming interfaces</A> in C and
FORTRAN are provided with Priism to allow you to write applications that
extend Priism's capabilities.

<P>The Priism interface consists of a menu bar from which you can select
an application to run.  From the <EM>Help</EM> menu of the menu bar you can
look up the online help for an application in the menus.  The <EM>File</EM>
menu has an option to close Priism and any open applications.

<P>At the end of the menu bar are two buttons that will affect any open image
windows.  <EM>-Section+</EM> will cause all open display window to display
either the previous (if you click on the minus end of the button) or the
next (if you click on the plus end of the button) two-dimensional section
of data. The <EM>-Zoom+</EM> button works similarly, but it changes the
magnification at which data is displayed in all the open display windows.

<H2><A NAME="ColorTables">Color Tables</A></H2>
<P>The "Change lookup table" entry in Priism's Color menu allows you
to change the palette of colors used when displaying images in pseudocolor.
Any change will affect all image windows.

<P>The "Change lookup table" menu has a set of predefined color tables and
a "Load..." option for loading your own tables.  The predefined color tables
are set by the CONFIG/LUT.def file in the Priism directory.  The standard
tables are:

<DL>
  <DT>Standard Grey<DD>The colors range from black for the lowest scaled
    image values through increasingly bright shades of grey for larger scaled
    values.  This is the palette Priism will use when it starts.
  <DT>Inverse Grey<DD>The colors range from white for the lowest scaled image
    values through successively dimmer shades of grey for larger scaled
    image values. 
  <DT>Spectrum<DD>As the scaled image values increase, the colors span
    the gamut starting with black followed by shades of blue, cyan, green,
    yellow, and red.
  <DT>Rainbow<DD>The lowest and highest scaled values appear in the same
    color, purple.  For intermediate scaled values, the colors range
    from shades of blue, to green, to red.
</DL>

<P>The "Load..." option in the "Change lookup table" menu will open a
dialog for selecting a color table, viewing the gamut of colors, and
applying the color table to Priism's image windows.  To select the color
table, either enter its file name directly in the text field at the top
of the dialog or press the "File" button and use the file selection dialog
that appears to choose the file.  Priism can handle two types of
color table formats:

<DL>
  <DT>The ASCII format MayaVi uses<DD>A header line as LOOKUP_TABLE
    followed by white space followed by the table name with no embedded
    white space followed by the number of table entries.  The table
    entries appear in order with one entry per line.  Each entry has
    red, green, blue, and alpha components (in that order), and each
    component is a floating point value between zero and one.
  <DT>The binary PAL format<DD>The file has 768 bytes of data representing
    a 256 entry color table.  The first 256 bytes hold the red components,
    the second 256 bytes hold the green components, and the final 256 bytes
    hold the blue components.
</DL>

<P>If you have selected a color table that Priism understands, Priism will
display the gamut of colors immediately below the "File" field.  The
toggle buttons below the gamut control possible transformations that Priism
can apply to the color table.  The toggle buttons are:

<DL>
  <DT>skip<DD>If the color table has more colors than Priism can use,
    turning on this toggle button will cause Priism to skip roughly
    evenly spaced colors throughout the gamut.  The skip, truncate, and
    shift transformations are mutually exclusive.
  <DT>truncate<DD>If the color table has more colors than Priism can use,
    turning on this toggle button will cause Priism to ignore the colors
    at the end of the table.  The skip, truncate, and shift transformations
    are mutually exclusive.
  <DT>shift<DD>If the color table has more colors than Priism can use,
    turning on this toggle button will cause Priism to ignore colors at
    the beginning of the table.  The skip, truncate, and shift transformations
    are mutually exclusive.
  <DT>reverse<DD>Reverses the order of the color table entries.  Reversing
    the order occurs before the skip, truncate, or shift transformations.
</DL>

<P>Pressing the "Apply" button at the bottom of the dialog causes Priism to
use the selected color table for all image windows.  Pressing the "Close"
button at the bottom of the dialog closes the dialog.

<P>The Priism programming interface has five parts:
<DL>

<DT><A HREF="IM_ref2.html">IM Library</A>
<DD>Provides functions for manipulating Priism data files.

<DT><A HREF="IW.html">IW Library</A>
<DD>Builds on the IM library to provide functions for manipulating graphics
windows and the data they contain.

<DT><A HREF="WM.html">WM Library</A>
<DD>Is a toolkit for building menus and dialogs.  If you use this library,
you will also need to link with the IW library.

<DT><A HREF="IP.html">IP Framework</A>
<DD>Provides a skeleton application for image processing (especially 2D).  You
customize it by writing callback routines.

application.
