<H2>Overview</H2>

<H2><A NAME="Compression">Compression</A></H2>
<P>The compression schemes available will depend on which compression
components are installed on your system.  Listed below are compression
components that Apple included with QuickTime 1.6 and have been included with
subsequent versions of QuickTime.  By default, the plugin will use the Photo
(JPEG) compression scheme.

<DL>
  <DT>Animation<DD>Compresses the movie with a lossless (run-length
    encoding) scheme appropriate for sequences of drawings.
  <DT>Cinepak<DD>Is like the Video scheme but decompresses more quickly
    at the expense of much longer compression times.   The compression
    algorithm is affected by the <A HREF="#Quality">quality</A> and
    <A HREF="#KeyFrameInterval">key frame interval</A> parameters.
  <DT>Photo (JPEG)<DD>Compresses each frame of the movie separately with
    the standard JPEG lossy compression algorithm.  The
    <A HREF="#Quality">quality parameter</A> controls the lossiness of
    the compression.
  <DT>Graphics<DD>This is a lossless compression algorithm which, in
    comparison to the Animation compression scheme, is more effective at
    compression but takes longer to decompress. 
  <DT>Video<DD>Compresses the movie with a lossy compression scheme
    designed for desktop video.  The <A HREF="#Quality">quality parameter</A>
    affects lossiness of the compression.
</DL>

<P><A HREF="#QuickTime">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="CompressionImplementation">Compression Implementation</A></H2>
<P>In some instances, more than one component implementing the same compression
scheme may be installed on your system.  Use the implementation parameter
to set the heuristic the plugin uses to choose the component.  The available
options are:

<DL>
  <DT>Any<DD>Use the first component which implements the compression scheme.
  <DT>Best Speed<DD>Use the fastest component which implements the compression
    scheme.
  <DT>Best Fidelity<DD>Use the most accurate component which implements the
    compression scheme.
  <DT>Best Size<DD>Use the component which will produce the smallest
    compressed output.
</DL>

<P><A HREF="#QuickTime">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Quality">Quality</A></H2>
<P>The quality parameter controls how much the decompressed version of the
compressed data differs from the original data.  Allowing greater deviations
can decrease the size of the compressed output.  Some compression schemes do
not allow control over the amount of deviation and ignore this parameter.  The
available options are:

<DL>
  <DT>Minimum<DD>Allows the most deviations from the original.
  <DT>Low<DD>Allows the most deviations from the original while still
    maintaining "acceptable" display characteristics.
  <DT>Normal<DD>Allows an amount of deviations acceptable for normal image
    quality.
  <DT>High<DD>Allows the smallest amount of deviation possible while
    maintaining "reasonable" performance.
  <DT>Maximum<DD>Allows the fewest possible deviations.
  <DT>Lossless<DD>If the compression scheme supports lossless compression,
    then this option is available to allow no deviation from the original.
</DL>

<H2><A NAME="TemporalCompression">Temporal Compression</A></H2>
<P>Some compression schemes can do more than treat each image in a sequence
independently.  For those compression schemes, you can turn on the
"Temporal Compression" toggle to allow the compression scheme to use the
similarities and differences between images to improve compression.  When
temporal compression is enabled, the
<A HREF="#KeyFrameInterval">key frame interval</A> also affects the compressed
results.

<P><A HREF="#QuickTime">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="KeyFrameInterval">Key Frame Interval</A></H2>
<P>A larger interval between key frames will give a higher level of
compression and quicker playback than a smaller key frame interval.  A
smaller key frame interval is useful if you wish to stop and start the
movie to examine individual frames.  Key frame intervals in the range of
1 to 60 frames are allowed.

<H2><A NAME="CommandLine">Command Line</A></H2>
<P>When Image Capture is run from the command line on Mac OS X, you can use

<PRE>
    -format=qt
</PRE>

<P>as an option to Image Capture to have it generate a QuickTime movie.  To
further control the QuickTime output, you can append any of the following to
the -format=qt option (when appending first insert a comma: i.e.

<PRE>
    -format=qt,frate=5,compress="Sorenson Video 3",temporal
</PRE>

<P>):

<DL>
  <DT><CODE>frate=</CODE><VAR>frames_per_second</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the suggested playback rate; <VAR>frames_per_second</VAR> can
    be any value between 0.25 and 99.   When you do not set the playback rate,
    the playback rate for the generated movie will be 15 frames per second.

  <DT><CODE>compress=</CODE><VAR>algorithm_name</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the compression algorithm to use.  The allowed names are the
    same as those listed in the Image Capture user interface and will
    vary depending on which compression components are installed on your
    system.   Some of the names contain spaces or the other characters which
    may have special meaning to the shell so quote the name if necessary.  The
    algorithms that Apple included with QuickTime 1.6 and have been
    included with subsequent versions of QuickTime are:  Animation, Cinepak,
    Photo (JPEG), Graphics, and Video (consult the
    <A HREF="#Compression">compression topic</A> for more details about those
    algorithms).  If you do not specify a compress algorithm, the Photo (JPEG)
    algorithm will be used.

  <DT><CODE>select=</CODE><VAR>criteria</VAR>
  <DD>Sets which compression component is used if you have more than one
    component installed which implements the compression algorithm you
    selected.  The allowed values for <VAR>criteria</VAR> are any,
    best_speed, best_fidelity, and best_size; for more details about what
    those choices mean, consult the
    <A HREF="#CompressionImplementation">compression implementation topic</A>.
    Unless you specify otherwise, the first implementation (i.e. the "any"
    option) of an algorithm will be the implementation that is used.

  <DT><CODE>qual=</CODE><VAR>quality</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the quality of the output when the QuickTime movie is decompressed.
    The allowed values for <VAR>quality</VAR> are min, low, normal, high, max,
    and lossless; for more information about what those choices mean, consult
    the <A HREF="#Quality">quality topic</A>.  If you do not specify the
    quality, the movie will have "normal" quality when decompressed.

  <DT><CODE>temporal</CODE>
  <DD>Include this option to enable
    <A HREF="#TemporalCompression">temporal compression</A>.  For compression
    schemes that always treat each frame independently, this option has no
    effect.

  <DT><CODE>kdist=</CODE><VAR>key_frame_interval</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the <A HREF="#KeyFrameInterval">key frame interval</A> to use
    when temporal compression is enabled.  <VAR>key_frame_interval</VAR>
    can be any integer value between 1 and 60.  If you do not set the key
    frame interval, the generated movie will use a key frame interval of 5.
