<H1>IVE: Reporting Bugs and Suggestions</H1>
<P>Please send e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:ive@msg.ucsf.edu">ive@msg.ucsf.edu</A>
describing the issue.  We appreciate descriptive subject lines (<EM>Subject:
bug</EM> or <EM>Subject: crash</EM> are not descriptive).  For bugs or
other unexplained ills in IVE, it's also useful to include the following
information:
<UL>
  <LI>the IVE version
  <LI>the type of machine you were using and the operating system it uses
  <LI>for X errors and behavior of application windows, details about the
    X server (vendor and version number) and, if you use Linux, which
    window manager you use; sending the output generated by running xdpyinfo
    in a terminal window is a good way to let us know the characteristics of
    the X server
  <LI>for drawing artifacts or other graphics problems in the image windows
    or the model display of 3D Model, information about the X server,
    OpenGL configuration, and graphics hardware can be useful; sending
    the contents of the file, .ive_last_monitor_config, in your home directory
    and the output generated by running glxinfo in a terminal window is a good
    way to inform us about the OpenGL configuration of your system  
  <LI>if the problem occurred with a particular data set and you are a
    user at MSG, the path to the data set
</UL>

<P>When making a suggestion, it is often useful to us if you describe in
general the type of analysis/visualization/measurement that you'd like
to do in addition to the specific change you have in mind.
