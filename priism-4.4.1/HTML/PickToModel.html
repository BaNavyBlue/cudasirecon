<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>This application converts a list of points in the
<A HREF="Pick.html">Pick Points</A> format into a format usable in
<A HREF="3DModel.html">3D Model</A>.  It works with the old format and not
the new object library format.  To convert the new format, load it into
Pick Points and write it out in the old format.

<P>To perform the conversion, enter the file name for the point list to
convert in the field next to the "Pick file" button or use that button to
browse for the file (alternatively, if the point list is already loaded into
a window with Pick Points, simply specify the window number in the field next
to the "Image file" button).  You will also need to supply the name of an
image file or image window number in the field next to the "Image file"
button; the coordinate system information in the header of that file or
window is used to convert the pixel coordinates in the list of points to the
units expected in the model file.  Enter the name of the output file in the
button next to the "Model file" button.  Then press the "Doit" button to
perform the conversion.

<H2><A NAME="CommandLine">Command line</A></H2>
<P>Rather than using the graphical interface, the conversion can be done
from the command line.  The form of the command line is:
<PRE>
     picktomodel <VAR>image_file</VAR> <VAR>pick_file</VAR> [<VAR>model_file</VAR>]
</PRE>
<P>Where you should replace <VAR>image_file</VAR> with the name of the image
stack (this may be a window number if Priism is running) and
<VAR>pick_file</VAR> with the name of the file in Pick Points format.  The
last argument is optional.  If not present (or just a dash), the model file
is written to standard output; otherwise the third argument is used as the
name of the model file.  As an example,
<PRE>
     picktomodel embryo_a1.dat embryo_a1.pts embryo_a1.model
</PRE>
<P>would read the Pick Points file, embryo_a1.pts, and write out its contents
as the 3D Model file, embryo_a1.model, using the coordinates from the header
of the image stack, embryo_a1.pts.
