<H1>Priism 3D Modeling Strategies</H1>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>Modeling features of your image data can be an important tool to aid in
the understanding of the 3 Dimensional nature your data.

<H2>Model Categories</H2>
<P>There are two basic categories of 3D Models in Priism.  Volume models can
be used to model things like nuclei, cell boundaries, etc. Line models are
suited for looking at metaphase chromosomes or neurons. The approaches for
creating these types of models are quite different.

<H2>Creating Volume Models</H2>
<P>Priism offers many tools for manual and automated extraction of volume
model elements.  Here are the basic steps in the process:

<OL>
  <LI><STRONG>Data preparation</STRONG>.  In order for you or an automated
    algorithm to be able to distinguish features in the data, it may be
    necessary to prepare the images by filtering, thresholding, or enhancing
    the contrast.  These tools are found primarily in the Processing menu of
    the Priism menu.
  <LI>Identification of polygons on 2D sections.  2D Polygons are the basic
    building blocks of Volume models. A facility exists to create and edit
    polygons (<A HREF="EditPolygon.html">Edit Polygon</A>).  It includes both
    manual and automated tools.  If the data thresholds nicely (such that
    desired features are easily distinguishable when the lower threshold is
    raised; see <A HREF="Threshold.html">Threshold</A> and
    <A HREF="FindBorder.html">Find Border</A>) then an automated tool
    (<A HREF="2DObjFinder.html">2D Object Finder</A>) can be used to create
    polygons. Once a polygon set is created, you can further refine the
    polygons using Edit Polygon.<BR>

    Another use for a set of polygons is in the creation of masks (see
    <A HREF="CutMask.html">Cut Mask</A>).

  <LI><STRONG>Assembling 2D polygons into 3D objects</STRONG>.  The next step in
    the process is to assemble the polygons created on 2D sections as 3D volume
    objects.  The tool used for this task is
    <A HREF="VolumeBuilder.html">Volume Builder</A>. The inputs for the tool
    are an image stack (file or window) and a polygon data set. If polygons
    are actively associated with a window (if, for example, you have just
    created polygons using 2D Object Finder), Volume Builder will attach to
    those polygons when you specify the window as the input image.  Once the
    input image and polygon set are specified, you can choose Create Objects
    to have Volume Builder attempt to associate 2D Polygons from section to
    section, thereby creating 3D objects. Tools exist to modify the
    associations determined by Volume Builder.<BR>

    Once the 3D volume objects are created, you can generate several
    measurements and models from them. Volume Builder can be used to generate
    tables of 2D and 3D measurements and several types of wireframe and solid
    model representations of the objects.

  <LI><STRONG>Viewing the Model</STRONG>.  If you have used Volume Builder to
    create wireframe or solid models of the objects, you can then use
    <A HREF="3DModel.html">3DModel</A> to view and rotate the models in a 3D
    viewing canvas. 
</OL>

<H2>Creating Line Models</H2>
<P>Line models can be created that trace objects such as chromosomes or neurons
through 3D space. The model, once created, can then be used to extract data
from image to perform 3D karyotyping. Line models are created using the
following steps:

<OL>
  <LI><STRONG>Data Preparation</STRONG>. As with the building of volume
    models, the extraction of linear models may require some preparation of
    the image data for you or the automated algorithms to best trace features
    in 3D.  Various tools in Priism's Processing menu may be helpful.

  <LI><STRONG>Tracing features in 3D</STRONG>.
    <A HREF="3DModel.html">3DModel</A> is used to manually or automatically
    trace model objects.  To manually add points to the model, you click on
    features in the image window(s).  By default, 3DModel attaches to all
    windows (up to number 19) that are open; this can be modified within
    3D Model.  It may be useful to have the standard image stack
    loaded in one window and a version of the same image that has been
    rotated in some way (see <A HREF="Rotate3D.html">Rotate 3D</A> or
    <A HREF="VolumeViewer.html">Volume Viewer</A>) loaded in another window.<BR>
    More automated tracing of tubular structures may be possible using the
    automodel option in 3DModel's options menu or the stand-alone tool,
    Tracer.  Both are described in <A HREF="Tracer.html">Tracer.html</A>.
    The 3DModel's automodel requires that you specify a starting point;
    it then searches through the image volume for a path that is constrained
    by parameters that you can control.  You can choose to have process attempt
    to identify the entire object in one shot or to do a stepwise search which
    allows for user intervention to get through areas of noisy data.  The
    stand-alone Tracer is more highly automated.  It automatically identifies
    starting points and does not allow intervention during the tracing process.

  <LI><STRONG>Applying the Model</STRONG>.  Aside from the measurements
    reported by 3DModel during the model creation and editing process, you can
    use line models to extract information from the image data.  The
    <A HREF="Strait.html">Straight</A> tool is designed to take line models
    and extract tubes of data from the image and display the results in
    various ways.  If applied to chromosomes, this may be a way to do 3D
    karyotyping.
