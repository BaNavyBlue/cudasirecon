<H1><A NAME="FPPolygons">FindPoints Polygons</A></H1>
<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>FindPoints Polygons is similar to
<A HREF="2DObjFinder.html">2D Object Finder</A>.  It segments image data by
assuming that pixels with zero intensity are not part of the features of
interest and that the parts with positive intensity are.  The edges of the
features of interest are then traced and recorded as polygonal cross-sections.
FindPoints Polygons has two additional capabilities:

<UL>
  <LI>FindPoints Polygons can work with the mask files generated by
    <A HREF="FindPoints.html">Find Points</A> or
    <A HREF="RegGrow.html">Region Growing</A>, which label separate regions
    with different values and use zero for points which are not in any region.
    Turn on the "Separate by mask" toggle when working with these files
    (unless you do want to lump together everything that is not background).
  <LI>FindPoints Polygons will associate the polygonal cross-sections into
    3D structures without the need to run the stand-alone application,
    <A HREF="VolumeBuilder.html">Volume Builder</A>.  Volume Builder may
    still be useful for editing how the cross-sections are associated,
    taking measurements of the 3D structures, or to convert the 3D structures
    into a form that can used with <A HREF="3DModel.html">3D Model</A> or
    <A HREF="Clouds.html">Clouds</A>.
    <A HREF="FindPoints.html">Find Points</A> and
    <A HREF="SurfHarmMod.html">SurfHarmMod</A> are two applications that
    can utilize the polygons and cross-section associations.
</UL>

<P>FindPoints Polygons' user interface uses the <A HREF="Region.html">same
set of controls</A> for selecting and processing a region as other Priism
applications.  There are additional controls to enter the name of the
polygon (.Pol) file and the name of cross-section association (.Vol) file.
The <A HREF="#border">"exclude edge objs" toggle and "edge size" field</A>
control how objects which intersect the edges of an image are handled; these
controls can be useful as a workaround for edge artifacts in the input
images.  The coarseness of the polygonal cross-sections, which has a
strong effect on the time needed to manipulate the polygons in other programs,
is set from the <A HREF="#ptdist">"dist between pts" field</A>.  If the
input is to be treated as a binary mask (a positive value marks the pixels
in the object of interest and a value of zero marks the pixels outside
that object), then turn the "Separate by mask" toggle off.  If the input
has different regions marked by different positive values and you want
to distinguish those regions in the output, turn the "Separate by mask"
toggle on.

<P>FPPolygons does not segment the points that are within <VAR>n</VAR> pixels
of the sides of the image where <VAR>n</VAR> is the value in the "edge size"
field.  If the "exclude edge objs" toggle is on, FPPolygons filters out any
polygons that have one or more vertices within <VAR>n</VAR>+1 pixels of the
sides of the image.

<H2><A NAME="ptdist">Point distance</A></H2>
<P>Adjacent points in the polygonal cross-sections are separated by the
distance, in pixels, from the "dist between pts" field.  Using a larger value
gives coarser polygons but decreases the computational and drawing effort for
programs that will use the polygons.

<H2><A NAME="commandline">Command Line</A></H2>
<P>FPPolygons accepts the command-line arguments described in
<A HREF="Region.html#COMMANDLINE">Region.html</A>.  In addition, it has
the following options:

<DL>
  <DT><CODE>-binary</CODE>
  <DD>Forces FPPolygons to treat the data as binary data:  all positive values
    are grouped into the same object.

  <DT><CODE>-border=</CODE><VAR>n</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the number of pixels, <VAR>n</VAR>, along each edge that
    FPPolygons excludes from segmentation.  <VAR>n</VAR> must be a positive
    integer.  By default, FPPolygons excludes a one pixel wide border around
    the edge of the image.

  <DT><CODE>-exclude_edge</CODE>
  <DD>If specified, FPPolygons filters out any polygons that have a vertex
    within <VAR>n</VAR>+1 pixels of the sides of the image where <VAR>n</VAR>
    is the border size set with -border.

  <DT><CODE>-poly=</CODE><VAR>name</VAR>
  <DD>Causes FPPolygons to generate a file named <VAR>name</VAR> to store
    the polygon results.  If you do not use this option, FPPolygons
    does not save the polygons.

  <DT><CODE>-spacing=</CODE><VAR>s</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the distance between adjacent polygon vertices to be <VAR>s</VAR>
    pixels.  By default, FPPolygons will generate polygon vertices spaced
    four pixels apart.

  <DT><CODE>-vol=</CODE><VAR>name</VAR>
  <DD>Causes FPPolygons to generate a file named <VAR>name</VAR> to store
    the information about how to link the polygons outlines to form volumes.
    If you do not use this option, FPPolygons does not save the connectivity
    information.
</DL>

<P>The following example segments the contents of window 2 and saves the
polygons in /var/tmp/2.pol and the object connectivity information in
/var/tmp/2.bld:

<PRE>
    FPPolygons 2 -poly=/var/tmp/2.pol -vol=/var/tmp/2.bld
