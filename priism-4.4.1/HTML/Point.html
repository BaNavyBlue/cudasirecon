<H1><A NAME="Point">Point Values</A></H1>
<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>Point Values displays the coordinates and data value (intensity) for
the point currently under the mouse.  Optionally, it will display the
x and y profiles of the data set through that point.

<P>For a window in pseudocolor mode, the currently displayed wave will be
the one whose data is reported.  With truecolor mode, the user has control
 over which wave's point values will be reported (see the
<A HREF="#WAVE_NUM">Wave topic</A> for details).  In the case that you want to
see the values for more than one wave at the same time, simply run the Point
Values utility once for each wave (however, because of a bug, displaying the
profiles from more than one of these does not work well).

<P>When the cursor is over an image, this field will contain the number of the
window displaying that image.  When the cursor is not on an image, this
field is blank.

<P>Use this option menu to select which wave's point values and profiles
are reported when working with a data set with multiple wavelengths that
are shown simultaneously in RGB mode.  The current wave selection is shown as
the label of the menu.

<P>If the mouse enters a window in pseudocolor mode or a window in RGB
mode which does not have the wave selected, the wave selection will
automatically switch to the wave with the lowest index that is displayed.

<H2><A NAME="X_Y">Position</A></H2>
<P>The position of the cursor in the data set is shown in the <EM>X</EM>,
<EM>Y</EM>, <EM>Z</EM>, and <EM>T</EM> fields.  The first column of
numbers are the pixel coordinates, which in each dimension can range from
zero to the number of points in that dimension minus one.  The second
column is the position in the coordinate system defined by the tilt angles,
origin, and pixel spacing from the data set's header.

<H2><A NAME="Intensity">Intensity</A></H2>
<P>The intensity (density, data value) at the point in the data set
under the mouse is shown in the <EM>Intensity</EM> field.  When the data
is complex, the value is shown is the same quantity used to calculate
the image - either the real component, imaginary component, amplitude,
or phase.

<P>When the <EM>X profile</EM> toggle is on, a profile along x running
through the point beneath the cursor is overlayed on the image.  Similarly,
when the <EM>Y profile</EM> toggle is on a profile along y is shown.  Two
straight lines, one vertical and one horizontal, mark the lines along which
the profiles are taken.

<P>By default, the plot is scaled so that the full range of values in
the wavelength (these values are read from the dataset's header and are
not recalculated) can be displayed in a region with one half the height
of the image (for the x profile) or one half the width of the image
(for the y profile).  To compress the width and height, use the
<EM>Page Down</EM> key that's not on the numeric keypad or the nine key on
the main keyboard.  To expand the plot, use the <EM>Page Up</EM> key or the
zero key.
