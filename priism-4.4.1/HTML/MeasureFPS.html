<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>As a diagnostic or performance measure, you may want to determine how
often an image window redraws its contents.  Measure FPS is an interactive
application to measure the rate of redraws; it is available from the
Image menu on the image windows.

<P>Measure FPS provides two forms of measurement:
<DL>
<DT>Manual<DD>If the Continuous toggle is off, Measure FPS will start
counting the number of redraws when the Start button is pressed.  When the
Stop button is pressed, it will report the elapsed time and the number of
draws per second over that interval.  Pressing the Start button again
before stopping the previous measurement will restart the measurement.
<DT>Continuous<DD>If the Continuous toggle is on, pressing the Start button
will cause Measure FPS to make a redraw rate measurement every <VAR>x</VAR>
seconds where <VAR>x</VAR> is the value show in the "Update interval" field.
Running results for the average frame rate, minimum frame rate, maximum
frame rate, and number of measurements will be displayed.  Pressing the Stop
button will stop the measurements.  Pressing the Start button again before
the measurement has stopped will reset the running results.  The update
interval may be modified while measurements are in progress but the running
results are not reset when the update interval is changed.
