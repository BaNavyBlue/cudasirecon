<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>Display Attributes allows you to view and alter many of the parameters
controlling how images are displayed in an image window.  To view or change
the default parameters that are used, use Priism's
<A HREF="Preferences.html">Preferences dialog</A>.  Display Attributes runs
in one of two modes.  The first presents a graphical user interface for viewing
and changing an image window's parameters.  All of the topics listed below,
except for the <A HREF="#CommandLine">"Command Line"</A> and
<A HREF="#QueryOutput">"Query Output"</A> topics, describe elements of that
graphical user interface.  The second mode reads the command line for the
changes to make to an image window, performs those changes, and then exits.
The <A HREF="#CommandLine">Command Line</A> topic describes that mode.

<H2><A NAME="GrDisRange">Graphics Display Range</A></H2>

<P>When an image window displays a section of data, the graphics from
nearby z slices and time points can be included in the display.  Let f1, f2,
f3, and f4 be the four values shown in the "GrDisRange" field.  Then the
section with z index, z0, and time point index, t0, will include the
graphics from sections whose z index is between z0 minus f1 and z0 plus f2 and
whose time point index is between t0 minus f3 and t0 plus f4.

<H2><A NAME="WinGeom">Window Geometry</A></H2>

<P>You can alter any of the values here to modify the window's geometry.
The first two values in this field specify the x and y position of the
lower lefthand corner of the monitor window, in pixels, as measured from
the lower lefthand corner of the screen.  The third and fourth values
specify the width and height in pixels of the image window (including
the associated menus and borders).

<P><A HREF="#DisplayAttr">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Zoom">Zoom</A></H2>
<P>Use the field labeled "Zoom", to change the zoom factor for images
displayed in the image window.  To zoom out (make the image smaller than
its normal size), enter "1/" followed by the integer factor by which the
size will be reduced.

<P><A HREF="#DisplayAttr">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="CurrentZWT">Current ZWT</A></H2>
<P>Use the field labeled "Current ZWT", to change which image is currently
displayed in the image window.  The first value in the field is the z index
of the current image.  The second value is the wavelength index.  The third
value is the time index.

<P><A HREF="#DisplayAttr">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="MatrixDisplay">Matrix Display</A></H2>

<P>Use this field to split up the window into multiple images.  The
two numbers in this field set the number of columns and rows respectively.
The images are displayed in order of increasing index from left to right
and from bottom to top.

<P><A HREF="#DisplayAttr">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="MatrixLayout">Matrix Layout</A></H2>
<P>Use the menu labeled, "Layout", to change the ordering of images when
the image window displays multiple images in a grid.  The first option in
the menu, "Data", places the first image in the lower left corner and the
last image in the upper right corner.  The image index increases from left to
right and then from bottom to top.  The second option in the menu, "Text",
places the first image in the upper left corner and the last image in the
lower right corner.  The image index increases from left to right and then
from top to botoom.

<H2><A NAME="Step_Inc">Step Increment</A></H2>

<P>This field sets the number of images skipped when moving to the
next or previous image.

<H2><A NAME="StepDirection">Step Direction</A></H2>

<P>This menu controls which subset of images are displayed as you step through
the images or display multiple images at once using the option for
<A HREF="#MatrixDisplay">matrix display</A>.  There are four available options:
<DL>
  <DT>Section<DD>Step through all the images in the order they are stored.
  <DT>Z<DD>Step through z sections for the current time point.
  <DT>Time<DD>Step through time points for the current z section.
  <DT>Wavelength<DD>Step through the different wavelengths for the current
    time point and z section.
</DL>

<H2><A NAME="Interpolation">Interpolate Zoom</A></H2>

<P>When on, enlarged images (zoom greater than one) are displayed
using a bilinear interpolation.  Otherwise, no interpolation is
applied and a pixel value from the unenlarged image is used unmodified
for a square set of pixels in the enlarged version.

<P><A HREF="#DisplayAttr">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="BufferImage">Buffer Image</A></H2>

<P>When on, the data after scaling is stored to save time if
the image needs to be redisplayed.  To reduce the amount of memory
used, you can turn off the buffering of the scaled data.

<P><A HREF="#DisplayAttr">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="ShowImage">Show Image</A></H2>

<P>When off, images are not shown in the window.  This can be useful
if you just want to see the overlayed graphics.  Typically, however,
you will want the image display to be switched on.

<P><A HREF="#DisplayAttr">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="ShowGraphics">Show Graphics</A></H2>

<P>When off, any graphics overlayed on the image are not shown (with the
exception of the section number display).  Typically, you will want the
graphics switched on.

<P><A HREF="#DisplayAttr">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="ScalingAlgorithm">Scaling Algorithm</A></H2>

<P>Two choices of scaling algorithm are offered.  The <EM>Fast</EM> option
uses a lookup table to speed the scaling process with the drawback that
it becomes increasingly inaccurate for scaling floating point or complex
data as the scaling exponent gets farther away from one.  The
<EM>Accurate</EM> option takes roughly twice as much time but accurately
does the scaling in nonlinear cases.  Generally, the <EM>Fast</EM> option
is reasonable for most work.

<P><A HREF="#DisplayAttr">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="ComplexDataDisOpt">Complex Data</A></H2>

<P>When displaying complex data, the quantity displayed as an image intensity
can be the real component, the imaginary component, the magnitude, or the
phase (in radians) of the complex number.  This menu allows you to select
which of these options is used.

<P><A HREF="#DisplayAttr">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="WaveSynching">Wave Synching</A></H2>

<P>This pulldown gives you control over which section is displayed when
you switch waves after changing the section displayed.  With
<EM>Same Z Section</EM>, when you change waves the z and time index of the
data shown will not change:  the different waves remain in sync.  With
<EM>Independent</EM>, when you change waves the data displayed will be
the data that was last displayed for that wave:  scrolling through the
data in one wave has no effect on the section that will be displayed after
you switch to displaying another wave.   With <EM>Coupled</EM>, when you
step forward in one wave, you will also step forward.  This behavior is
similar to what happens with <EM>Same Z Section</EM>; the difference is
that the <EM>Coupled</EM> option doesn't force the z and time index to be
the same when waves are switched.

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="ScaleBar">Scale Bar</A></H2>

<P>Use this to control whether or not the scale bar, a line to indicate
the physical dimensions of the image, is shown.  The <EM>Label</EM> option
currently just has the same effect as <EM>On</EM>.

<P><A HREF="#DisplayAttr">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Width">Scale Bar Width</A></H2>

<P>This entry specifies the thickness of the scale bar in pixels.

<P><A HREF="#DisplayAttr">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Color">Scale Bar Color</A></H2>

<P>Use this menu to select the color of the scale bar.  The color options
can be changed by using <A HREF="ChangeColors.html">ChangeColors</A>.

<P><A HREF="#DisplayAttr">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Length">Scale Bar Length</A></H2>

<P>This field sets the length of the scale bar in terms of the physical
units for dimensions the data set, i.e. angstroms for electron microscope
data and microns for optical microscope data.

<P><A HREF="#DisplayAttr">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Direction">Scale Bar Direction</A></H2>

<P>Toggles whether the scale bar is shown horizontally or vertically.

<P><A HREF="#DisplayAttr">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Position">Scale Bar Position</A></H2>

<P>This field sets the x and y position of the scale bar, in pixels, as
measured from the lower lefthand corner of the image window.  For horizontal
scale bars, this position is the center of the left edge of the scale bar;
for vertical scale bars, this position is the middle of the bottom edge of
the scale bar.

<P>You can select the position of the scale bar by pressing the <EM>Select
with Mouse</EM> button and then clicking on the desired position in the
image window with the right mouse button.

<H2><A NAME="CommandLine">Command Line</A></H2>
<P>Display Attributes runs in one of two modes.  If started with this
command line, <CODE>DisplayAttr</CODE> <VAR>window_number</VAR>, Display
Attributes will display a graphical user interface for viewing and modifying
the parameters for image window numbered <VAR>window_number</VAR>.  If one or
more additional entries appear after <VAR>window_number</VAR> on the command
line, Display Attributes will not display the graphical interface.  Instead,
it will perform the actions which specified by the command line options and
then exit.  The exit status will be zero if all of the actions were successful.
The exit status will be one if one or more of the actions failed.  The
command line options that Display Attributes understands in the second mode
are:
<DL>
  <DT><CODE>-buffer</CODE> or <CODE>-no-buffer</CODE>
  <DD>The first turns on image buffering for the image window.  The second
      turns off image buffering.

  <DT><CODE>-complex=</CODE><VAR>conversion</VAR>
  <DD>Specifies how the image window will convert complex-valued data to
    a single quantity for display as an image.  <VAR>conversion</VAR> must be
    real, imag, amp, or phase.  'real' causes the image to display the real
    component of the data.  'imag' causes the image to display the imaginary
    component of the data.  'amp' causes the image to display the amplitude
    of the data.  'phase' causes the image to dipslay the phase, in radians,
    of the data.

  <DT><CODE>-graphics</CODE> or <CODE>-no-graphics</CODE>
  <DD>The first turns on graphics overlayed on the images.  The second turns
    off those graphics.

  <DT><CODE>-grrange=</CODE><VAR>zneg</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>zpos</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>tneg</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>tpos</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the display range for graphics overlayed on the images.  If the
    current section's z and time indices are zc and tc, any graphic whose z
    index is between zc - <VAR>zneg</VAR> and zc + <VAR>zpos</VAR> and whose
    time index is between tc - <VAR>tneg</VAR> and tc + <VAR>tpos</VAR> will
    appear on the current section.

  <DT><CODE>-image</CODE> or <CODE>-no-image</CODE>
  <DD>The first turns on image display in the image window.  The second turns
    off image display (only the overlayed graphics, if any, will be shown).

  <DT><CODE>-interpolate</CODE> or <CODE>-no-interpolate</CODE>
  <DD>The first turns on bilinear interpolation for images shown with a zoom
    factor greater than 1.  The second turns off interpolation for zoomed in
    images.

  <DT><CODE>-layout=data</CODE> or <CODE>-layout=text</CODE>
  <DD>Sets how the image window orders the images when multiple images are
    displayed in a grid.  The first form, <CODE>-layout=data</CODE>, places the
    first image in the lower left and the last image in the upper right.  The
    image index increases left to right and from bottom to top.  The second
    form, <CODE>-layout=text</CODE>, places the first image in the upper left
    and the last image in the lower right.  The image index increases from left
    to right and from top to bottom.

  <DT><CODE>-matrix=</CODE><VAR>num_columns</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>num_rows</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the image window to display up to <VAR>num_columns</VAR> times
    <VAR>num_rows</VAR> images simultaneously in a grid with
    <VAR>num_rows</VAR> rows and <VAR>num_columns</VAR> columns.
    <VAR>num_columns</VAR> and <VAR>num_rows</VAR> must be integers.  You may
    omit <VAR>num_rows</VAR> and the separating colon:  in that case,
    Display Attributes will assume that you want one row.

  <DT><CODE>-position=</CODE><VAR>xpos</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>ypos</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the screen position, in pixels, of the image window's lower left
    corner.  The position (0, 0) corresponds to the lower left corner of the
    screen.  The x position increases as one moves across the screen to the
    right.  The y position increases as one moves up the screen.
    <VAR>xpos</VAR> and <VAR>ypos</VAR> must be integers.

  <DT><CODE>-query</CODE>
  <DD>Prints the current attributes of the image window to standard output.
    The topic, <A HREF="#QueryOutput">"Query Output"</A>, describes what is
    printed.

  <DT><CODE>-res=</CODE><VAR>i</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the index of the currently displayed resolution level to be
    <VAR>i</VAR>.  <VAR>i</VAR> must be an integer greater than or equal to
    zero and less than the number of resolutions.

  <DT><CODE>-scalebar</CODE> or <CODE>-scalebar-labeled</CODE> or <CODE>-no-scalebar</CODE>
  <DD>The first turns on the display of the scale bar without a label.  The
    second turns on display of the scale bar with a label indicating the length
    of the scale bar.  The third turns off display of the scale bar.

  <DT><CODE>-scaling=</CODE><VAR>algorithm</VAR>
  <DD>Selects the scaling algorithm to use.  If <VAR>algorithm</VAR> is
    <CODE>fast</CODE> the window will use a lookup table that sacrifices
    accuracy for speed when working with floating-point or complex-valued data
    and the scaling exponent is different from one.  If <VAR>algorithm</VAR>
    is <CODE>accurate</CODE>, the image window will not use a lookup table
    when the data is floating-point or complex-values and the scaling exponent
    is different than one.

  <DT><CODE>-scbcolor=</CODE><VAR>c</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the color for the scale bar.  The color must be one of the twelve
    colors selected for overlay graphics.  <VAR>c</VAR> may be the color's
    index, an integer between zero and eleven, or the color's name.

  <DT><CODE>-scblength=</CODE>
  <DD>Sets the length of the scale bar to be <VAR>l</VAR> of whatever units
    are used for the pixel spacing of the image.  <VAR>l</VAR> must be a
    floating-point value.

  <DT><CODE>-scbpos=</CODE><VAR>xpos</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>ypos</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the position of the scale bar within the image display.  A position
    of (0, 0) corresponds to the lower left corner of the image display.  The
    x coordinate increases as one moves right across the display.  The y
    coordinate increases as one moves up the image display.  For a horizontal
    scale bar, the specified position is the location for the middle of the
    scale bar's left edge.  For a vertical scale bar, the specified position
    is the middle of the scale bar's bottom edge.

  <DT><CODE>-scbthick=</CODE><VAR>t</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the scale bar to be <VAR>t</VAR> pixels thick.  <VAR>t</VAR> must
    be an integer.

  <DT><CODE>-scb-horizontal</CODE> or <CODE>-scb-vertical</CODE>
  <DD>The first selects a horizontal scale bar.  The second selects a vertical
    scale bar.

  <DT><CODE>-scl1=</CODE><VAR>sclmin</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>sclmax</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>sclexp</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>sclflag</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the scaling parameters for the first wavelength.  The scaling
    parameters have the same meaning as the parameters do for the
    <A HREF="Scale.html">Image-&gt;Scale dialog</A> for the image window.
    The parameters must be floating-point values.  <CODE>-scl2=</CODE>,
    <CODE>-scl3=</CODE>, <CODE>-scl4=</CODE>, and <CODE>-scl5=</CODE> are
    similar to <CODE>-scl1=</CODE> but affect the second through fifth
    wavelengths, respectively.

  <DT><CODE>-secnum</CODE> or <CODE>-no-secnum</CODE>
  <DD>The first turns on display of the section number on each image.  The
    second turns off display of the section number on each image.

  <DT><CODE>-size=</CODE><VAR>width</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>height</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the width and height, in pixels for the image window.  The
    width and height must be integers.

  <DT><CODE>-sncolor=</CODE><VAR>c</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the color for the section number display.  The color, <VAR>c</VAR>,
    may be the color's index, an integer between zero and eleven, or the
    color's name.

  <DT><CODE>-step=</CODE><VAR>dir</VAR>
  <DD>Selects the direction to use when stepping through the data with
    the mouse buttons, mouse scroll wheel, scroll bar control in the image
    window display, or the gridded image display option (i.e. -matrix).
    <VAR>dir</VAR> must be <CODE>s</CODE>, <CODE>section</CODE>,
    <CODE>z</CODE>, <CODE>t</CODE>, <CODE>time</CODE>, <CODE>w</CODE>,
    <CODE>wave</CODE>, or <CODE>wavelength</CODE>.  <CODE>s</CODE> or
    <CODE>section</CODE> cause the image window to step through the images in
    the order they are stored.  <CODE>z</CODE> causes the image window to step
    through images by their z index.  <CODE>t</CODE> or <CODE>time</CODE>
    cause the image window to step through the images by their time index.
    <CODE>w</CODE>, <CODE>wave</CODE>, or <CODE>wavelength</CODE> cause the
    image window to step through the images by their wavelength index.

  <DT><CODE>-stepsize=</CODE><VAR>s</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the number of images to move in the chosen direction in response to
    one mouse press, click in the scroll bar, or step in the matrix display.
    <VAR>s</VAR> must be an integer.

  <DT><CODE>-sync=</CODE><VAR>m</VAR>
  <DD><CODE>-sync=same</CODE> sets the image window to force the current
    image for each wavelength to have the same z and time indices.
    <CODE>-sync=none</CODE> or <CODE>-sync=independent</CODE> causes the
    image window to not enforce any relationship between the z and time
    indices for the current images in different wavelengths.
    <CODE>-sync=coupled</CODE> sets the image window so that a change of
    <VAR>dz</VAR> and <VAR>dt</VAR> to the z and time indices of one
    wavelength's current image adds <VAR>dz</VAR> and <VAR>dt</VAR> to the
    indices of the current image in all other wavelengths (those indices
    are then coerced to fall within the bounds of the data set).

  <DT><CODE>-zoom=</CODE><VAR>zf</VAR> or
    <CODE>-zoom=1/</CODE><VAR>f</VAR>
  <DD>The first form sets the zoom factor for the image to be <VAR>zf</VAR>
    where <VAR>zf</VAR> must be a floating-point value.  The second form sets
    the zoom factor for the image to be 1 / <VAR>f</VAR> where <VAR>f</VAR>
    must be a positive integer.

  <DT><CODE>-zwt=</CODE><VAR>zindex</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>waveindex</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>timeindex</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the current section for the image window to have a zindex equal to
    <VAR>zindex</VAR>, a wavelength index equal to <VAR>waveindex</VAR>, and
    a time point index equal to <VAR>timeindex</VAR>.  <VAR>zindex</VAR>,
    <CODE>waveindex</CODE>, and <VAR>timeindex</VAR> must be integers.
