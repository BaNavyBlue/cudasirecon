<H1><A NAME="Flip">Flip</A></H1>
<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>Essentially, Flip allows you to view your dataset from the "side" -
so that what once Z axis (the axis perpendicular to the screen when an image
is viewed) will now fall in the plane of the screen.  Be cautious in how
you visually interpret the results of Flip. You are most often looking at
data where the size of the pixels in the X dimension and the Y dimension
are equal.  The Z pixel size (section spacing) is often quite different
different from X and Y, but in a flipped view the pixels are still
represented as square, so the aspect ratio will not be 1-to-1.  To obtain
a 1-to-1 aspect ratio, use <EM><A HREF="Resample2D.html">Resample2D</A></EM>
and adjust the magnification on the X or Y axis to equate the X and Y pixel
spacings.

<P>Use this menu to select the orientation of the output.  The names of the
selection indicate which of the axes in the input will fall along the X and Y
axes of the output.  With <EM>X-Z Sections</EM>, for instance, the old X axis
will run along the new X axis and the old Z axis will run along the new Y axis.

<P>At a minimum, Flip keeps at least one output section in memory, and
it will keep more if the total amount of memory used is less than the
value, in units of megabytes, shown in the "Working space" field.  You can
adjust the amount of memory Flip uses by changing the value in the
"Working space" field.  Using more memory (provided that it is not already in
use for other processes) will generally speed up the process for yz or zy
flipping operations.  For xz flipping operations, determining the optimal
amount of memory to use is more difficult.  If the data set to be flipped is
much bigger than the physical memory available (in other words, Flip will not
be able to make effective use of the operating system's caches), telling Flip
to use more memory will usually speed up the flipping operation.  If the data
set to be flipped is small enough to fit in the physical memory available,
entering zero in the "Working space" field will usually be the optimal
strategy.

<H2><A NAME="CommandLine">Command Line</A></H2>
<P>Flip accepts the command-line arguments described in
<A HREF="Region.html#COMMANDLINE">Region.html</A>.  To set the desired
orientation of the output from the command line, include one of the following
options:

<DL>
  <DT><CODE>-xz</CODE><DD>The output generated has xy sections that correspond
    to xz sections from the input.  This is the default.
  <DT><CODE>-yz</CODE><DD>The output generated has xy sections that correspond
    to yz sections from the input.
  <DT><CODE>-zy</CODE><DD>The output generated has xy sections that correspond
    to zy sections from the input.
</DL>

<P>To set the <A HREF="#WorkingSpace">working space</A>, include

<PRE>
    -maxmem=<VAR>n</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>in the options where you would replace <VAR>n</VAR> with the desired amount
of memory to use in megabytes.  If you do not set the size of the working
space from the command line, Flip will use 64 megabytes (or at least enough
space for one output section if an output section is bigger than 64 megabytes).

<P>As an example, the following command interchanges the y and z axes of
recon.xzyw and puts the result in recon.xyzw:

<PRE>
     Flip recon.xzyw recon.xyzw
</PRE>
