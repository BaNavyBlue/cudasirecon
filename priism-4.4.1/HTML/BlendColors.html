<H1>BlendColors</H1>
<H2><A NAME="overview">Overview</A></H2>
<P>BlendColors allows you to assign a different color to each wave while
also giving you the capability to tailor the color to fit your own preferences.
Normally, you would use BlendColors to generate images for inclusion in
publications or presentations.

<P>BlendColors generates colors by combining 3 primary colors, red, green, and
blue:  any color BlendColors uses is represented by three values between
zero and one where each value indicates the strength of the contribution
from one of the primaries.  As an example, the color with a red component
of 0.55, a green component of 0.13 and blue component of 1 is a shade of
purple.  When you use BlendColors you will assign a color (some combination
of red, green, and blue) to each wavelength in your input data.  When
BlendColors calculates the color for a point in the output it will use a
weighted combination of the colors of the input wavelengths; the weights
are the scaled intensity at the point in each wavelength.  With the way
Priism stores image files, BlendColors' output will have either three
or four "wavelengths".  The first three "wavelengths" hold the red, green,
and blue components, respectively, for the result of the weighted combination
of the input colors.  The optional fourth "wavelength" holds the opacity,
how opaque a pixel is; the opacity is useful when constructing
<A HREF="VolumeViewer.html">volume renderings</A> of your data.

<P>Tuning how the input is scaled is an important part of getting good
looking results from BlendColors.  It is generally easiest to do some
of that tuning prior to running BlendColors:  load your data into an
image window, turn on RGB display for that image window, and then use
the <A HREF="Scale.html">Image-&gt;Scale menu entry</A> in the image window
to adjust the scaling for the different wavelengths so that the relative
brightness of the different wavelengths is close to what you want in
the final output.  For instance, if you wanted to limit the contribution from
one wavelength, you would stretch the maximum scaling value well past
the upper limit for that wavelength's data values.  After you have
done the initial tuning of the scaling, use the image window where you did
the tuning as the input to BlendColors:  BlendColors will automatically
pick up your modified scaling values.  Another aid for tuning the scaling
is BlendColors' <A HREF="#scaling_menu">scaling menu</A>.  It works
after you have done an initial run with BlendColors:  if you saved the
output from that run to an image window, the you can use the scaling menu
to adjust the scaling and see the effect on the currently displayed section
of the blended result.  After you have refining the scaling with the scaling
menu, you would then press "DoIt" again in BlendColors to ensure that the
updated scaling has been applied to all sections of the output.

<P>A basic recipe for using BlendColors is

<OL>
  <LI>(optional) Load the data you wish to blend into an image window and
    tune the scaling to get close to the desired balance between the
    wavelengths.
  <LI>Enter the image window (i.e. the one used in step one) or file name to
    process in the "Open" field at the top of the BlendColors dialog.
  <LI>Enter the image window or file name for the output in the "Save" field
    near the top of the BlendColors dialog.  If you use an image window
    for the output, you can use the <A HREF="#scaling_menu">scaling menu</A>
    to refine the scaling parameters once you have done one run through
    BlendColors.
  <LI>Choose the colors to use for each input wavelength.  To see the
    current selection of colors or to load or save color parameters, use
    the "color parameters..." button in BlendColors' main dialog.  To
    select a color from a color wheel and use that color for a particular
    wavelength, press the "color wheel..." button in BlendColors' main dialog.
    Some things to keep in mind as you select colors are:
    <UL>
      <LI>The COLORS directory at the top level of the Priism directory has
        color parameter files that others found to be useful.
      <LI>When you select colors, dark blue is a poor choice and will not
        print well.
      <LI>If you are going to print the picture, some software (the
        Image-&gt;Print menu entry in Priism's image windows, for instance)
        is not intelligent enough to ensure that the printed colors match
        what you see on the screen.  If the software can't help you to match
        the colors, one rule of thumb, especially if you are printing to
        transparencies, is to choose your colors and scaling so the image
        appears somewhat brighter than you want when you display
        it on the screen.
    </UL>
  <LI>Select the <A HREF="#method">method to use for blending</A> the
    colors from the different wavelengths.  If you plan to use the output
    for <A HREF="VolumeViewer.html">volume rendering</A>, you probably
    want to turn on the "opacity" toggle button as well (you could also
    wait to do so until you've finished refining the scaling parameters).
  <LI>Press the DoIt button at the bottom of the BlendColors dialog to
    generate the blended result.
  <LI>(optional) If the output was written to an image window, you can
    use BlendColors' <A HREF="#scaling_menu">scaling menu</A> to adjust
    the scaling parameters at this point.  Once you've adjusted those to
    your liking,  pressing "DoIt" again will ensure that the output is
    completely consistent with the adjusted parameters.

<H2><A NAME="scale">Scaling Parameters</A></H2>
<P>Before blending the different wavelengths, BlendColors scales the data.
The parameters controlling the scaling (a minimum, maximum, exponent, and flag
value) for each wavelength are shown in the "scale 0" through "scale 4" fields
in BlendColors' main dialog.  For more details about the scaling calculation
and the handling of the four scale parameters, see the
<A HREF="Scale.html#Scale">"Scaling Values" topic</A> in the documentation for
the <A HREF="Scale.html">image window's Scale application</A> (note that the
special case where the minimum and maximum are both zero does not apply to
the behavior of BlendColors).  When you select a new input data set for
BlendColors, BlendColors will adjust the scaling values to match the new input:
if the input is a file, the scaling will be linear between the minimum and
maximum values recorded in the file's header; if the input is an image window,
the scaling will match that used for the image window.

<H2><A NAME="color_parameters">Color Parameters</A></H2>
<P>BlendColors has two dialogs to help you assign colors to the input
wavelengths.  The first, which you can open by pressing "color wheel..."
in BlendColors' main dialog, allows you to select the color for a wavelength
from a palette.  The color wheel at the top of the dialog is the palette.
Position the mouse over the desired color in the wheel and press the mouse
button to select a color.  Your selected color, in a range of intensities,
will then appear in the bar just below the color wheel.  If you are satisfied
with the color, use the toggle buttons below the bar to select the wavelength
you want to assign to that color and then press the "accept color" button.

<P>The other dialog, which you can open by pressing "color parameters..."
in BlendColors' main dialog, displays your currently selected colors for
each wavelength.  Just below that display the dialog has the RGB components
for each color; you can edit the component values directly if you want.
The dialog has three buttons to assist with saving the color parameters for
use in the future or for restoring previously saved parameters:

<DL>
  <DT>save colors to file<DD>Saves the color parameters as a text file.
  <DT>load new colors from file<DD>Displays a file selection dialog which
    you can use to select a previously saved set of color parameters.  The
    COLORS directory at the top level of the Priism distribution has some
    previously generated color parameter files.
  <DT>set a default color file<DD>Displays a file selection dialog which you
    can use to select a color parameter file.  The next time you run
    BlendColors, BlendColors will load those color parameters automatically.
    BlendColors stores the name of the default color file in the blend.select
    file located in the .iveprefs subdirectory of your home directory.

<H2><A NAME="method">Blending Method</A></H2>
<P>BlendColors uses one of three methods to combine the scaled intensities
for the input wavelengths and the assigned colors for those wavelengths to
generate the blended result.  Let I(j) be the scaled intensity (a value between
zero and 255) for wavelength j at a pixel, C(i,j) be the ith component (i.e.
the red component for i equal to one) of the color assigned to wavelength j,
and B(i) be the ith component of the blended result for the pixel.  With the
additive method, the blended color at the pixel is the weighted sum of the
wavelength colors with the scaled intensities at the pixel as the weights:

<PRE>
    B(i) = C(i,1) * I(1) + C(i,2) * I(2) + ...
</PRE>

<P>With the maximum intensity method, BlendColors finds the wavelength, k,
which has the brightest scaled intensity at the pixel (if there is tie,
BlendColors uses the wavelength with a lower value of k).  The blended color
for that pixel is then the color for wavelength k times the scaled intensity
for wavelength k, i.e.

<PRE>
    B(i) = C(i,k) * I(k)
</PRE>

<P>The priority method treats one of the input wavelengths, the
<A HREF="#priority">lowest priority wavelength</A>, differently than the
others.  If the lowest priority wavelength is k, the blended color at a pixel
is

<PRE>
    B(i) = C(i,1) * I(1) + ... + C(i,k-1) * I(k-1) +
            C(i,k) * maximum(0, I(k) - I(1) - ... I(k-1) - I(k+1) - ...) +
            C(i,k+1) * I(k + 1) + ...
</PRE>

<P>In other words, the blended color calculation is similar to the additive
method but the lowest priority wavelength only contributes to the result at
a pixel if the scaled intensity for the lowest priority wavelength at that
pixel is greater than the sum of the scaled intensities for the other
wavelengths.

<P>When BlendColors computes the opacity (B(4) to use the same notation as
above) for a a pixel, the unweighted opacity for each wavelength, i, (C(4,i))
is one.

<P><A HREF="#overview">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="opacity">Opacity</A></H2>
<P>When the "opacity" toggle button is on, BlendColors generates output
with four "wavelengths" rather than three.  The fourth "wavelength" records
how transparent each point is:  information that is useful with the progressive
rendering option of <A HREF="VolumeViewer.html">Volume Viewer</A>.

<P>BlendColors uses the scaled intensity at a pixel as a measure of its
opacity:  a pixel with a scaled intensity of zero is completely transparent
and a pixel with a scaled intensity of 255 is completely opaque.   BlendColors
then blends opacities in each wavelength just as it blends the red, green, and
blue components.

<P><A HREF="#overview">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="priority">Lowest Priority Wavelength</A></H2>
<P>The assignment of the lowest priority wavelength only has significance
when you select the <A HREF="#method">priority method</A> as the method
for blending colors.  For that method, the contribution of the lowest priority
wavelength to the blended result at a pixel is reduced by the sum of the scaled
intensities in the other wavelengths, and if the scaled intensity in the lowest
priority wavelength at a pixel is less than the sum of the scaled intensities
for the other wavelengths, the lowest priority wavelength does not contribute
to the blended color at that pixel.  When you use the priority method of
blending, select the wavelength to use as the lowest priority wavelength with
the toggle buttons to the right of the "lowest" label.

<P><A HREF="#overview">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="scaling_menu">Scaling Menu</A></H2>
<P>If you have BlendColors save the blended images in an image window,
BlendColors will enable the "scaling..." button after you generate the
blended data.  Pressing the "scaling..." button opens a dialog with which
you can adjust the scaling parameters for the input.  The scaling controls
in the dialog mimic those in the <A HREF="Scale.html">Image-&gt;Scale dialog</A>
for image windows.  As you adjust the scaling, BlendColors will update the
currently displayed blended section to match the new scaling.  Once you are
satisfied with the scaling, press "DoIt" in BlendColors' main dialog to ensure
that all the sections of the blended result are computed with the new scaling
parameters.

<P><A HREF="#overview">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="command_line">Command Line</A></H2>
<P>BlendColors accepts the command-line arguments described in
<A HREF="Region.html#COMMANDLINE">Region.html</A>.  In addition, it has
the following options (parts in brackets are optional):

<DL>
  <DT><CODE>-color1=</CODE><VAR>r</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>g</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>b</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the red (<VAR>r</VAR>), green (<VAR>g</VAR>), and blue
    (<VAR>b</VAR>) components for the color assigned to the first wavelength
    in the input.  There are similar options (<CODE>-color2</CODE>,
    <CODE>-color3</CODE>, <CODE>-color4</CODE>, and <CODE>-color5</CODE> to
    set the colors for the other wavelengths).  If you do not set the color
    for a wavelength with a -color1 (-color2, ...) or -colors option,
    BlendColors will use black if you do not have a default color file or will
    use the color in your default color file.

  <DT><CODE>-colors=</CODE><VAR>color_file</VAR>
  <DD>Causes BlendColors to use the colors in <VAR>color_file</VAR> as
    the colors it assigns to the wavelengths in the input.  A -colors option
    will override any previous -color1 (-color2, ...) or -colors options that
    appear on the command line.

  <DT><CODE>-lowest_priority=</CODE><VAR>i</VAR>
  <DD>Specifies that the wavelength with the zero-based index, <VAR>i</VAR>,
    in the input will be lowest priority wavelength for the priority
    blending algorithm.  By default, BlendColors uses the first wavelength in
    the input file as the lowest priority wavelength.

  <DT><CODE>-method=</CODE><VAR>name</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the algorithm BlendColors uses to blend different wavelengths.
    The allowed values for name are additive, max_intensity, and priority.
    For more information about those algorithms, consult the
    <A HREF="#method">method topic</A>.  If you do not explicitly set a method,
    BlendColors will use the additive algorithm.

  <DT><CODE>-opacity</CODE>
  <DD>If set, BlendColors will generate output with four wavelengths where
    the fourth wavelength stores the opacity.

  <DT><CODE>-scl1=</CODE><VAR>bound1</VAR>[<CODE>:</CODE><VAR>bound2</VAR>[<CODE>:</CODE><VAR>exp</VAR>[<CODE>:</CODE><VAR>flag</VAR>]]]
  <DD>Sets the scaling parameters for the output drawn from the first
    wavelength of the input.  Takes one to four parameters; parameters not
    specified take on their default values (see the
    <A HREF="#scale">scale topic</A> for what the default values are).
    The first two parameters are the intensity bounds for scaling, the third
    is the exponent, and the fourth sets what happens to data values outside of
    the intensity bounds.  The documentation for the image window's
    <A HREF="Scale.html">Scale function</A> describes the parameters in
    more detail.  There are similar options (<CODE>-scl2</CODE>,
    <CODE>-scl3</CODE>, <CODE>-scl4</CODE>, and <CODE>-scl5</CODE> to set the
    scaling for the other input wavelengths).
</DL>

<P>The following example generates the blended result, blend.dat, from fish.dat
and the color parameter file, scotts.blend, in the Priism COLORS directory.
The example uses the priority blending algorithm with the second wavelength in
the input as the lowest priority wavelength.

<PRE>
    BlendColors fish.dat blend.dat -colors=${IVE_BASE}/COLORS/scotts.blend \
        -method=priority -lowest_priority=1
