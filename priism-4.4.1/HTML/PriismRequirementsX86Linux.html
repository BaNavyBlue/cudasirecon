<H1>Installation Requirements for Priism 4 on x86 Linux</H1>
<P>The x86 Linux version of Priism includes files for 32-bit and 64 bit
(x86_64) systems.  The 32-bit files are usable on both 32-bit and 64-bit
systems provided that 32-bit versions of the required libraries are available.
The 64-bit files are only usable on 64-bit systems and need 64-bit versions
of the required libraries.

<H2>Operating system</H2>
<P>You need a version of Linux installed that supports ELF binaries and has
system libraries that are compatible with glibc 2.3.  Priism makes use of
libc.so.6, libdl.so.2, libgcc_s.so.1, libm.so.6, libpthread.so.0, and
librt.so.1.  Priism also requires libstdc++.so.6.

<H2>Required libraries and additional software</H2>
<DL>
  <DT>X<DD>It is necessary to have the X libraries installed and in
    the library search path (libXt.so.6, libXi.so.6, libXext.so.6,
    libXft.so.2, libXrender.so.1, libX11.so.6, libSM.so.6, libICE.so.6,
    libfreetype.so.6, and libz.so.1).  To use the components that have
    graphical user interfaces, it is necessary to have an X server and window
    manager running.  Priism 4 has been used with XFree86 3.36, XFree86 4, and
    Xiq Graphics X server.  In many cases, the X server will only support
    true color visuals or pseudocolor visuals but not both, and typically
    only one hardware color map is available for pseudocolor visuals.
    Because of those limitations, it is often best to configure your X
    server to use 24 or 32 bit color; 16 bit color is also feasible but that
    severely restricts the number of distinct colors available for greyscale
    images.  The command-line application, xdpyinfo, will print out the
    current capabilities of the X server:  look for the list of visuals
    at the end of the output and the "number of colormaps" line which,
    hints at the number of hardware colormaps available.  The window
    manager should be ICCCM compliant (namely it should cooperate and
    install the colormap for the window with input focus), and if it is
    compatible with mwm, then certain minor features in Priism that modify
    the window manager decorations will work correctly.
  <DT>OpenGL/Mesa<DD>To use the components with graphical interfaces,
    it is necessary to have the OpenGL library, libGL.so.1, (or their
    Mesa equivalents) installed and in the library search path.  The
    versions of libGL.so.1  shipped with RedHat 6.2 and Suse 8.2 do not
    work; no problems have been reported with other versions.
</DL>

<H2>Optional libraries and additional software</H2>
<DL>
  <DT>Matlab<DD>Priism includes the ImgToMat and MatToImg tools to convert
    Priism image files to and from Matlab's .mat files.  To use those
    converters, you have to have Matlab 6.5 or 7 installed (for the
    64-bit version you need Matlab 7).
</DL>

<H2>Optional Hardware</H2>
<P>The GPU-accelerated calculations for EM tomography require an x86 or
x86_64 Linux system with an appropriate NVIDIA graphics card.  That system
does not need to be the as the system where you run Priism. The
<A HREF="EMCAT/Parallel.html#GPUParallel">"GPU Parallel Settings" section of EMCAT/Parallel.html</A>
describes the hardware and software requirements for the GPU-accelerated
calculations in more detail.

<P>If you have a Volume Pro 1000 board installed and the driver library
(libvli3.so) is in the shared library path (it will be for a standard
installation), Priism's Volume Viewer will use the Volume Pro 1000 for
hardware accelerated volume rendering.  Priism's Volume Viewer has been tested
with versions 3.0 and 3.2 of the driver library.

<H2>Disk space</H2>
<P>During installation, you need space for the downloaded archive and the
uncompressed files; the uncompressed files do not need to be on the same disk
as the downloaded archive.  Once the software is installed, the downloaded
archive may be deleted.  The space required is 130 megabytes during
installation and 95 megabytes afterwards.

<P>While the software is running, it makes extensive use of a shared memory
file and related temporary files.  The amount of space needed for these
files depends on the size of the data sets loaded, but a minimal configuration
should have 200 megabytes of space available for these files and having
approximately 500 megabytes of space available would be better. 
<A HREF="PriismInstallation.html#Step4">Step 4</A> of the installation
procedure describes how the default location for the shared memory and
temporary files is set in the sample setup scripts.
