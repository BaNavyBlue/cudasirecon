<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>This dialog allows you to view and edit the settings which
control the behavior of the help system and the initial appearance and
behavior of <A HREF="Monitor.html">image windows</A>.  Once an image window is
started, its controls and the <A HREF="DisplayAttr.html">Display Attributes</A>
application can be used to customize it.

<P>You can have different versions of the preferences and switch between them
using the selection widget near the top of the dialog.  Each version is
referred of the settings is referred to as a <EM>profile</EM>.  For more
information on profiles and their management see
<A HREF="#Profiles">Managing Profiles</A>.

<P>To view and edit a subset of the settings, select a category from the
<EM>Preferences</EM> menu (the second menu at the top of the dialog).
After selecting a category, a dialog will appear in which you can examine and
change the values.  Changes are not saved and will not take effect until the
<EM>Save</EM> is selected from the <EM>File</EM> menu.  You can remove any
changes made since the last save by selecting <EM>Restore</EM> from the
<EM>File</EM> menu.

<H2><A NAME="Profiles">Managing Profiles</A></H2>

<P>Each profile is a complete set of the parameters available for
controlling an image window and the help system.  The profiles currently
defined are listed in the selection box near the top of the dialog, and the
one currently in use is highlighted and also shown below the dialog.  The
following paragraphs describe how to use the <EM>Preferences dialog</EM> to
switch, create, and delete profiles.

<P>To switch profiles, simply choose one of the other choices in the
selection box.  If you made any changes to the current profile, you
will be asked if you want to switch and discard the changes.  A switch takes
effect immediately and affects all windows launched after the switch (except
for the parameters in the "Startup" category; changes there only take effect
if you exit and restart Priism).

<P>Select <EM>New...</EM> from the <EM>File</EM> menu to create a new profile.
You will be prompted for the name of the profile (this can not be the same as
the name of an existing profile), whether to use the current profile as the
starting values for the new one (otherwise the unmodified system defaults
are used), and, if changes have been made to the current profile, whether
or not to save those changes before switching to the new one.  Profiles
are saved as text files in the .iveprefs subdirectory of your home directory.
The files with the .ivepref extension contain the image window preferences,
and the files with the .helppref extension contain the help system preferences.

<P>Select <EM>Delete</EM> from the <EM>File</EM> menu to delete the
current profile and associated disk file.  The new current profile will be the
system defaults.

<DL>
  <DT><STRONG>Startup</STRONG>
  <DD>
    <DL>
      <DT><A NAME="PseudoOffset">Pseudocolor offset</A>
      <DD>When displaying pseudocolor images, Priism has the option to
        offset its color table at the expense of addition computation in
        order to avoid colormap flashing when you switch from Priism to
        another application.  On SGIs when no offset is applied, colormap
        flashing always happens when running SGI GL applications (jot,
        showcase, snapshot) and Priism simultaneously;  using an offset
        greater than 256 (1000 has been used in the past) will avoid this
        except on Indys with 8 bit graphics.  The offset has no effect when
        using the default colormap or when emulating pseudocolor.

      <DT><A NAME="NumberOfImageColors"># of image colors</A>
      <DD>This is the maximum number of colors that Priism will use when
        displaying images in pseudocolor (i.e. if the image is displayed with
        a grey colormap then this is the number of greys used).  You may want
        to limit this number if you simultaneously use Priism and other
        applications that require many colors and allocate them from the
        default colormap.  You may specify that the maximum number of colors
        used is the default number (read from CONFIG/Monitor.def in the Priism
        directories), the maximum number possible, or the value that you enter.
        When pseudocolor is emulated, the maximum number of pseudo colors is
        always used.

      <DT><A NAME="UseDefaultColormap">Use default colormap</A>
      <DD>If your hardware only supports a small number of installed
        colormaps (you can determine this number by looking at the output
        of xdpyinfo) and you want to use the additional colormaps for
        applications other than Priism, turn on the toggle labeled
        "Use default colormap".  This causes Priism to attempt to allocate
        its colors from the default colormap.  You will also likely want to
        reduce the number of pseudocolors that Priism attempts to allocate.
        If the hardware only supports one installed colormap, Priism always
        attempts to use the default colormap.

      <DT><A NAME="EmulatePseudo">Emulate pseudocolor</A>
      <DD>By turning on the toggle labeled "Emulate pseudocolor", displaying
        images in pseudocolor will be done using an RGB visual rather than
        a colormapped one.  This eliminates potential color table conflicts
        with other applications but will likely slow down image display.

      <DT><A NAME="EnableStereoInWindow">Stereo in window</A>
      <DD>When the toggle labeled "Stereo in window" is on, Priism will
        prefer visuals capable of displaying stereo images in a window if the
        hardware provides them.  If the toggle is off, Priism will prefer
        visuals that are not capable of stereo images in a window.  This is
        off by default because using stereo-capable visuals causes display
        problems on some Macs.

      <DT><A NAME="PreferDoubleBuffer">Prefer double buffer</A>
      <DD>When the toggle labeled "Prefer double buffer" is on, Priism
        will preferentially use double-buffered visuals.  For most uses
        that is desirable because it allows for smoother updates of displayed
        images.  When the toggle is off, Priism will prefer single-buffered
        visuals.  That may be useful for testing or benchmarking, to reduce
        the resources Priism uses, or to work around problems with
        double-buffered visuals and the system's graphics drivers.

  <DT><STRONG>Image color</STRONG>
  <DD>
    <DL>
      <DT><A NAME="ImageColor">Display mode</A>
      <DD>Specifies whether images are composed of one wavelength
        in false color (psuedocolor mode) or of one to three
        wavelengths where each wavelength is represented by a
        different color component (RGB mode).

      <DT><A NAME="WaveColor">Wave 0, Wave 1, Wave 2, Wave 3, Wave 4</A>
      <DD>These menus specify the colors used for each wavelength
        when the image window is in RGB mode.  In RGB mode,
        the image displayed contains the data from one to three
        wavelengths each represented by different color components.

      <DT><A NAME="BkgColor">Background</A>
      <DD>Specifies the color for regions not covered by the image.
    </DL>

  <DT><STRONG>Zoom / resolution</STRONG>
  <DD>
    <DL>
      <DT><A NAME="Zoom">Zoom factor</A>
      <DD>Scales the size of the displayed images.

      <DT><A NAME="Interp">Interpolate zoomed images</A>
      <DD>For zoom factors greater than one, specifies whether to bilinearly
         interpolate the image.

      <DT><A NAME="Resolution">Resolution level</A>
      <DD>When multiple resolutions are available, selects the resolution
         used by default when the zoom factor is one.  One is the highest
         resolution; each higher value lowers the resolution in x and y by a
         factor of two.
    </DL>

  <DT><STRONG>Scale bar</STRONG>
  <DD>
    <DL>
      <DT><A NAME="Scalebar">Display mode</A>
      <DD>Selects whether to display a line to demonstrate the physical
        scale of the image; the <EM>Label</EM> option adds a label for
        the length of the line.

      <DT><A NAME="ScalebarColor">Color</A>
      <DD>Selects the color of the scale bar line and label.  The color
        options are set by the current set of graphics' colors.

      <DT><A NAME="ScalebarDir">Direction</A>
      <DD>Selects whether the scale bar line should be oriented vertically
        or horizontally.

      <DT><A NAME="ScalebarThick">Thickness</A>
      <DD>Specifies the width of the scale bar line in pixels.

      <DT><A NAME="ScalebarLength">Length</A>
      <DD>Specifies the length of the scale bar in physical units
        (typically microns for optical microscopy data and angstroms
        for electron microscopy).

      <DT><A NAME="ScalebarPos">Position</A>
      <DD>Specifies the location (of the center of the left edge for
        horizontal scale bars and of the middle of the bottom edge for
        vertical scale bars) of the scale bar relative to lower lefthand
        corner of the image window.
    </DL>

  <DT><STRONG>Window graphics</STRONG>
  <DD>
    <DL>
      <DT><A NAME="ShowGraph">Show graphics</A>
      <DD>Specifies whether or not graphics are overlayed on the image.
        This does not affect the section number display.

      <DT><A NAME="GrDisRange">Display range</A>
      <DD>When an image window displays a section of data, the graphics
        from nearby z slices and time points can be included in the
        display.  Let f1, f2, f3, and f4 be the four values shown
        in the "Display range" field.  Then the section with z index,
        z0, and time point index, t0, will include the graphics
        from sections whose z index is between z0 minus f1 and z0
        plus f2 and whose time point index is between t0 minus f3
        and t0 plus f4.

      <DT><A NAME="ColorList">Color list</A>
      <DD>Specifies the set of graphics' colors used.  These sets can
        be created or modified using
        <A HREF="ChangeColors.html">Change Colors</A>.
    </DL>

  <DT><STRONG>Window geometry</STRONG>
  <DD>
    <DL>
      <DT><A NAME="ImageWindowSize">Size</A>
      <DD>Specifies the size of image portion of the monitor window.  This
        differs from <A HREF="DisplayAttr.html#WinGeom">Display Attributes</A>
        where the size of the entire monitor window is set.

      <DT><A NAME="Border">Decorations</A>
      <DD>Specifies the border drawn around the monitor window.

      <DT><A NAME="ShowTools">Show tools</A>
      <DD>Specifies whether or not to show the controls displayed along the
        left side of the monitor window.
    </DL>

  <DT><STRONG>Multiple image display / step</STRONG>
  <DD>
    <DL>
      <DT><A NAME="MultDisplay"># columns</A>
      <DD>Specifies the number of columns of images to be displayed at
        once in each monitor window.

      <DT># rows
      <DD>Specifies the number of rows of images to be displayed at
        once in each monitor window.

      <DT>Order
      <DD>When multiple images are displayed in a monitor, specifies the
        order in which the grid of images is filled.  With the
        <EM>Bottom to top</EM> option (also referred to as the
        <EM>data format</EM>, the current section is displayed
        in the lower lefthand corner and the grid is filled from left to
        right and from bottom to top.  With the <EM>Top to bottom</EM>
        option (also referred to as the <EM>text format</EM>, the current
        section is displayed in the upper lefthand corner and the grid is
        filled from left to right and from top to bottom.  In either case
        as the grid is filled, the next section is determined on the basis
        of the <A HREF="#Step">step parameters</A>.

      <DT><A NAME="Step">Increment</A>
      <DD>Specifies the number of sections to jump when scrolling though
        sections in the monitor window or when displaying multiple sections
        at once.

      <DT>Dimension
      <DD>Specifies the dimension along which the user can move when
        scrolling through sections or along which the user can view the
        data set when displaying multiple sections at once.  The
        <EM>Section</EM> option specifies that the data be scrolled through
        in the order in which it is stored in the data file; the other
        options specify to use the z, time, or wave dimension of the data
        for scrolling.

      <DT>Wave synching
      <DD>Specifies what happens when a user scrolls through sections
        in one (or more) waves and then switches to view a wave that wasn't
        in view.  The <EM>Same Z Sec</EM> option specifies that when
        waves are switched, the z and time indices for the section do not
        change.  With the <EM>Independent</EM> option, the next section
        to view in a wave is not changed by scrolling through the other
        waves:  when waves are switched the last section viewed in the new
        wave is the one that is displayed.  With the <EM>Coupled</EM> option,
        scrolling in a wave or waves causes the next section to view in
        all other waves to be changed by the same amount; it differs from
        the <EM>Same Z Sec</EM> option in that it does not force the next
        section to be the same (only changes are coupled).
    </DL>

  <DT><STRONG>Keyboard and mouse settings</STRONG>
  <DD>
    <DL>
      <DT><A NAME="AutoRepeat">Autorepeat</A>
      <DD>When interacting with the image window, pressing and holding a key
        or pressing and holding a mouse button can repeat an action until the
        key or mouse button is released.  Two parameters affect the repetition:
        the autorepeat delay is the time the key or mouse must be held before
        the action is repeated for the first time and the autorepeat interval
        is the time that elapses between each subsequent repetition after the
        first.
    </DL>

  <DT><STRONG>Miscellaneous settings</STRONG>
  <DD>
    <DL>
      <DT><A NAME="ShowImg">Show image</A>
      <DD>Specifies whether or not images are shown in monitor windows
        (this may be useful if you want to see the overlayed graphics
        more clearly).

      <DT><A NAME="BufferImg">Buffer image</A>
      <DD>Controls whether or not the scaled data used to draw images
        is buffered.  When on, monitor windows can typically respond
        faster when redisplaying an image at the expense of increased
        memory usage.

      <DT><A NAME="Complex">Complex data as</A>
      <DD>Specifies how to convert complex data to a single value per
        pixel so it can be displayed as an image.  The options include
        using the magnitude, phase, real component, or imaginary component
        as the displayed quantity.

      <DT><A NAME="ScalingMethod">Scaling method</A>
      <DD>Specifies which algorithm to use when scaling data for an
        image.  The <EM>Fast</EM> method is about twice as fast as
        the <EM>Accurate</EM> one, but with floating point or
        complex data, the <EM>Fast</EM> method is subject to increasingly
        severe rounding problems (missing intensity levels in the image)
        as the scaling becomes more nonlinear.  For linear scales and
        non-complex integer data, there is no difference between the
        two methods.
    </DL>

  <DT><STRONG>Help browser</STRONG>
  <DD>
    <DL>
      <DT><A NAME="HelpButtonsActive">Help buttons active</A>
      <DD>Most graphical user interfaces in Priism use a type of button
        as labels.  If the "Help buttons active" toggle is on, pressing
        one of those buttons causes the related help topic to be displayed;
        otherwise pressing one of those buttons has no effect.

      <DT><A NAME="HelpBrowsingMethod">Method</A>
      <DD>The "Method" menu controls the mechanism used to display help
        information.  The available options (which are controlled by the
        help_browser.def configuration file in Priism's CONFIG directory)
        are:
        <DL>
          <DT>Internal .hlp Viewer<DD>Uses a primitive browser to display
            help files in the .hlp format.  This works on all systems but
            some of the .hlp files are out of date and the .hlp format does
            not allow for links or embedded images.
          <DT>X Windows Netscape Compatible<DD>For Linux or IRIX systems, uses
            a web browser which is compatible with the remote control features
            of Netscape for X Windows to display HTML help content.  Web
            browsers which are compatible with this mechanism are Firefox,
            Opera, Mozilla, and Netscape; you can adjust which browser is
            invoked by entering the executable name for the browser in the
            <A HREF="#HelpBrowserName">Browser field</A>.  The default is
            an executable provided by Priism, ive_netscape_wrapper, which will
            use either Firefox, Mozilla, or Netscape depending on what is
            installed on your system.
          <DT>AppleScript OpenURL<DD>For Macintoshes, uses a web browser
            which supports the OpenURL command to display HTML help content.
            Many web browsers (including Internet Explorer 5.2 and Mozilla 1.3)
            understand and correctly handle the OpenURL command.  Known
            exceptions are Safari (does not understand OpenURL) and Netscape 7
            (displays a blank page for file URLs). You can adjust which
            browser is invoked by entering the executable name for the browser
            in the <A HREF="#HelpBrowserName">Browser field</A>.
          <DT>Konqueror (KDE 3)<DD>Uses the KDE 3 version of Konqueror to
            display HTML help content.  This method assumes that the KDE
            communication server (dcopserver) is running.
          <DT>Safari<DD>For Macintoshes, invokes Apple's Safari to display
            HTML help content.  At a minimum, requires the second beta version
            or newer.
          <DT>Custom<DD>To display the help in a web browser not handled
            by one of the above methods, use the Custom method which will
            allow you to set any of the configurable parameters for
            invoking the browser.
        </DL>

      <DT><A NAME="HelpBrowserName">Browser</A>
      <DD>The contents of the Browser field are substituted for the first
        occurrence of %b in the commands to contact an existing browser or
        to launch a new one.  For some methods, the contents of the Browser
        field are fixed; other methods allow you to change the name of
        the browser.

      <DT><A NAME="ContactBrowserCommand">Contact</A>
      <DD>If the Contact field is not empty, the help system replaces
        the first occurrence of %b in the field with the browser name and
        the first occurrence of %s with the name of the content to display
        (if you want a %b or %s that will not be expanded, use %%b or %%s).
        The help system then uses the result as a command to display the
        help content.  If the command fails (by returning a nonzero exit
        status), then the help system will attempt to use the command, if
        any, given in the <A HREF="#LaunchBrowserCommand">Launch field</A>.
        As an example, if you wanted to use a text-mode browser like lynx,
        you could use<BR><CODE>xterm -e '%b' '%s'</CODE><BR>
        as the contact command, nothing for the launch command, and enter
        the executable name for the browser in the browser field.  For
        other examples of contact and launch commands, look at the
        help_browser.def file within the CONFIG directory of the Priism
        distribution.

      <DT><A NAME="LaunchBrowserCommand">Launch</A>
      <DD>If the Launch field is not empty and the Contact field is empty
        or the attempt to display the help content with the contact command
        failed, the help system replaces the first occurrence of %b in the
        field with the browser name and the first occurrence of %s with the
        name of the content to display (if you want a %b or %s that will not
        be expanded, use %%b or %%s).  The help system then uses the result
        as a command to display the help content.  The description of the
        <A HREF="#ContactBrowserCommand">Contact field</A> describes where to
        find examples of contact and launch commands.

      <DT><A NAME="HelpBrowserUsesHTML">Use HTML</A>
      <DD>If this toggle is on, the browser displays HTML content
        and the help system will pass the browser a URL in the form
        <CODE>file:///</CODE><VAR>file_name</VAR><CODE>#</CODE><VAR>topic_name</VAR>;
        otherwise, the browser displays content in the .hlp format and
        the help system will indicate the content to display by passing
        <VAR>file_name</VAR><CODE>#</CODE><VAR>topic_name</VAR>.  In both
        cases, the topic name and leading pound sign may or may not be present.
