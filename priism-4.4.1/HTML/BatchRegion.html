<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>Several Priism applications which use a command-line interface also
have a graphical interface to specify the command-line arguments and
some other aspects (priority, batch queue) of how the application will
be run.  The elements that these graphical interfaces have in common and
the corresponding command-line arguments are described in this document;
application specific elements are described elsewhere.

<P>At the top of the interface are entries for the input and output
files for the application.  For each file there is a button which you
can use to open a file selection dialog and a text field which
shows the current file selection.  You can change the selected file by
changing the name shown in the field.

<P>Below the file selection items, some applications display a series of
controls to select a subset of the input to process.  These controls are
further described in the <A HREF="#x_size">X Range</A>,
<A HREF="#y_size">Y Range</A>, <A HREF="#z_size">Z Range</A>,
<A HREF="#t_size">T Range</A>, and <A HREF="#wave">Wave</A> topics.  Other
applications simply display the size of the input data.

<P>The remainder of the dialog, with the exception of the buttons at the
bottom, contains items specific to the application.  The functions of the
buttons at the bottom are:

<DL>
  <DT>Exit
  <DD>Closes the dialog.

  <DT>Save
  <DD>Saves the current dialog settings to a file in your home directory.
      You can reload these settings at a later time using the Restore button.

  <DT>Restore
  <DD>Loads the dialog entries that had been previously saved using the
      Save button.

  <DT>Options
  <DD>Opens a dialog which allows you to control how the application will
      be run including whether or not a batch queue should be used, what
      priority the job should have, names for the command and script files,
      and whether or not to chain multiple jobs together.  For more
      information see the <A HREF="#priority">Priority</A>,
      <A HREF="#chain">Chain</A>, <A HREF="#queue">Queue</A>,
      <A HREF="#logfile">Logfile</A>, and <A HREF="#comfile">Comfile</A> topics.

  <DT>Do It
  <DD>If the option to chain jobs is turned off (this is set from the
      dialog opened by the Options button), pressing this button causes the
      application to be run with the current settings.  If the application
      is run on the current machine, the label on the button will be changed
      to <EM>Cancel</EM> while the job runs and pressing the button will
      terminate the job.<BR>

      The first time the <EM>Do It</EM> button is pressed after the option to
      chain jobs is turned on, nothing will be executed though the
      commands that would have been executed will be written to the command
      file.  The next time the "Do It" button is pressed, the commands to
      run the current job are written to a command file, a line is added
      to the previous command file to run the one with the commands
      for the current job, and the previous command file is executed.
      The label on the <EM>Do It</EM> button then changes to <EM>Cancel</EM>
      and the button can be used to cancel the combined jobs.

the size of the current input file:  either as the number of points along
each of the five dimensions (x, y, z, wavelength, and time) or as the number
of points along the x and y dimensions and the the number of sections.

file when the <EM>Do It</EM> button is pressed but are not submitted or run
until the next time the <EM>Do It</EM> button is pressed.  To use this
effectively to chain two jobs together, do the following

<OL>
  <LI>Turn the chain option toggle on.
  <LI>Set the parameters for the first job and press <EM>Do It</EM>.
  <LI>Change the name of the command file; using the same name as was
    used for the first job will cause the first job to run in an infinite loop.
  <LI>Set the parameters for the second job and press <EM>Do It</EM>.
  <LI>Turn the chain option toggle off.
</OL>

<P>Because submitting the second job turns the <EM>Do It</EM> button into a
button to cancel the currently running job, it is not generally possible to
chain more than two jobs together.

to run two tasks in sequence.

<P>When the "Skip execution" button on, pressing the "Do it" button only
generates a script of the commands to perform.  In this case, the
selection of the queue to use generally does not matter.  One exception
to that rule is parallel tasks since the default parallel execution parameters
are what has been configured for the currently selected queue.

<P>There is the option to run the application in a batch queue.  Use the
pulldown menu next to "Submit to queue" to select the batch queue to use or
use the <EM>run locally</EM> option to run jobs on the current machine without
using a queue.

<P>There are two ways to configure the queues listed in the dialog:  you can
set up a configuration file or you can set some environment variables.  The
former is more flexible and allows you to configure parallel execution settings
that can not be configured with the environment variables.  A configuration
file, if present, takes precedence over the environment variable settings.
Priism looks for configuration files in four places and uses the first it
finds.  The locations, in the order Priism searches them, are:

<OL>
  <LI><VAR>home</VAR>/.iveprefs/<VAR>host</VAR>-queues.def
  <LI><VAR>home</VAR>/.iveprefs/queues.def
  <LI><VAR>priism</VAR>/CONFIG/<VAR>host</VAR>-queues.def
  <LI><VAR>priism</VAR>/CONFIG/queues.def
</OL>

<P>where <VAR>home</VAR> is the user's home directory, <VAR>priism</VAR>
is the Priism installation directory, and <VAR>host</VAR> is the name, as
reported by the command "<CODE>uname -n</CODE>", of the machine where Priism
is running.

<H3>Queue Configuration Files</H3>
<P><A HREF="../EXAMPLE/queues.def">EXAMPLE/queues.def</A> in the Priism
distribution is an example of a queue configuration file.  You may want to
look at it first before plunging into the details below.

<P>The configuration file consists of a series of entries where each
entry is separated from the previous one by an end-of-line.  Entries can
be preceded by white space (spaces or horizontal tabs) and can be followed
by whitespace or a comment (a comment is introduced with a # character and
continues until the end of the line).  An entry is either a directive
which controls how the file is parsed or the definition of a property.

<P>There are five directives available.  They are:

<DL>
  <DT>HOST<DD>Introduces a set of definitions for the machine where Priism
    is running.  All properties up to the next HOST directive, QUEUE directive,
    or the end of the file are grouped together.
  <DT>QUEUE<DD>Introduces the definitions for a new destination queue.
    All properties up to the next HOST directive, QUEUE directive, or the end
    of the file are applied to that queue.
  <DT>IFHOST<DD>If the host name of the current machine is not included
    in the list of hosts following the IFHOST directive, all properties
    up to the matching ENDIF directive are read but ignored.
  <DT>IFNOTHOST<DD>If the host name of the current machine is included
    in the list of hosts following the IFHOST directive, all properties
    up to the matching ENDIF directive are read but ignored.
  <DT>ENDIF<DD>Terminates a previous IFHOST or IFNOTHOST directive.
</DL>

<P>As a consequence of the way the QUEUE and HOST directives are defined,
properties that are to be used for the entire system must appear before the
first QUEUE or HOST directives.

<P>The IFHOST and IFNOTHOST directives have an optional list of host names.
The list of host names must be separated from the IFHOST or IFNOTHOST
directive by white space.  The list is introduced by a { character and
terminated by a } character (} characters within host names do not terminate
the list).  Each element in the list is enclosed in double
quotes and the elements may be separated from each other by any combination of
white space, comments (which start with a # and continue till the end of the
line; the list will continue on the next line), or an end-of-line (the list
will continue on the next line).  If you want to include a literal double
quote in a host name, use a backslash followed by a double quote.  If you
want to include a literal backslash at the end of a host name use two
backslashes followed by the double quote.  If an IFHOST directive
does not have a list of host names or the list is empty, the properties up
to the terminating ENDIF are always excluded.  If an IFNOTHOST directive
does not have a list of host names or the list is empty, the properties up
to the terminating ENDIF are always included.

<P>Properties consist of a name followed by an optional value.  Names
consist of a sequence of characters (not including white space, # characters,
or end-of-lines) followed by white space, a # character, or an end-of-line.
A name must not be the same as one the of directives (if it is, it will
be processed as a directive).  There are four types of values:

<DL>
  <DT>boolean<DD>The value is either <CODE>true</CODE> or <CODE>false</CODE>.
  <DT>integer<DD>The value is a signed decimal integer (in other words
    an optional plus or minus sign followed by a sequence of digits).
  <DT>character string<DD>The value is introduced with a double quote
    (which is not included in the value itself) and continues until the
    next double quote (which does not have to be on the same line).  If
    you want to include a double quote in the value, use a backslash followed
    by a double quote.  If you want to include a backslash at the end of the
    value use a pair of backslashes followed by the double quote.
  <DT>a list of character strings<DD>The list is introduced by a { character
    and terminates with a } character (} characters within strings in the
    list do not terminate the list).  Each element in the list is enclosed
    in double quotes and the elements may be separated from each other by
    any combination of white space, comments, or end-of-lines.    If
    you want to include a double quote in the value, use a backslash followed
    by a double quote.  If you want to include a backslash at the end of the
    value use a pair of backslashes followed by the double quote.
</DL>

<P>Properties without a value are treated as if an empty character string
had been supplied as the value.

<P>Properties are distinguished by three attributes:  the name, the type
of value, and the enclosing context.  The enclosing context is introduced
by a HOST or QUEUE directive; any properties before the first or HOST or
QUEUE directive belong to the same context and are used as the properties
of the overall system.  If the three attributes are the same for two
properties then one of the following applies:

<UL>
  <LI>If the property's value is a boolean, integer, or character string,
    the property that appears later in the file takes precedence.
  <LI>If the property's value is a list of character strings, the lists
    are merged and the elements in the combined list will appear in the
    order they do in the file.
</UL>

<P>While any combination of the three attributes is possible only a handful
are recognized by the software and affect the graphical user interfaces or
submission of jobs.  For the overall system properties, four have special
meanings (the name of the property is show first followed by the expected
type in parentheses):

<DL>
  <DT>DefaultSerialQueue (character string)<DD>Holds the name of the default
    destination queue for serial (i.e. single processor) tasks.  If the
    character string is empty or there is no queue with the given name,
    the default destination for serial jobs is the local machine.
  <DT>DefaultThreadedQueue (character string)<DD>Holds the name of the
    default destintation queue for parallel tasks that can only run on
    something that is (or acts like) a single host.  If the character string
    is empty or there is no queue with the given name, the default destination
    for parallel tasks that use a single host is the local machine.
  <DT>DefaultClusterQueue (character string)<DD>Holds the name of the default
    destination queue for parallel tasks that may run on multiple hosts.  If
    the character string is empty or there is no queue with the given name,
    the default destination for parallel tasks that may run on multiple hosts
    is the local machine.
  <DT>DefaultGPUQueue (character string)<DD>Holds the name of the default
    destination queue for GPU-accelerated tasks.  If the character string is
    empty or there is no queue with the given name, the default destination
    for GPU-accelerated jobs is the local machine.
</DL>

<P>For the host properties, the following have special meanings:

<DL>
  <DT>DefaultBackgroundLoginOption (character string)<DD>Holds the option
    to pass to the login command when logging in to a node to run a task in
    the background.  This property defaults to "-n" if it is not set.
  <DT>DefaultLoginCommand (character string)<DD>Holds the command to use
    to login to a node.  This property defaults to "ssh -x" if not set.
  <DT>DefaultMachinesFile (character string)<DD>This is only relevant for
    queues or hosts where ProcessControl is "mpich-machines".  Holds the name
    of the MPICH-style machines file with the list of processor names to use.
  <DT>DefaultMPIRunCommand (character string)<DD>Holds the command necessary
    for starting an MPI job.  For systems or queues that set ProcessControl to
    "openmpi", the command must be OpenMPI's (version 1.3 or later) mpirun or
    mpiexec.
  <DT>DefaultNodeCheckCommand (character string)<DD>Holds the command to
    be executed before attempting to log in and run a task when ProcessControl
    is "mpich-machines" or "openmpi".  The intent of this is to work around
    problems with intermittent failures.  For instance, on some of the
    clusters we had there were occasional NFS mount failures as the parallel
    script runs; using a non-empty DefaultNodeCheckCommand can be used to
    insert a delay or a normal login to the compute node to prevent those
    failures.
  <DT>DefaultProcessorCount (integer)<DD>Holds the default number of
    processors to use for parallel jobs.
  <DT>Description (character string)<DD>Holds a longer description of the
    system for use in the user interface.
  <DT>GrecsrvBusyHosts (character string)<DD>Holds a comma-separated list of
    device IDs to ignore on each host.
  <DT>GrecsrvExecutable (character string)<DD>Holds the default path to
    GPU reconstruction server software.
  <DT>GrecsrvHosts (character string list)<DD>Lists the host name or address
    for hosts to use with the GPU reconstruction server software.  This would
    usually be used when the GrecsrvUseProcessControl property is false.
  <DT>GrecsrvMemoryPercentatge (integer)<DD>Holds the percentage of each
    device's onboard memory that the GPU reconstruction server will attempt to
    use.
  <DT>GrecsrvPort (integer)<DD>Holds the port number to use for GPU
    reconstruction server hosts that do not otherwise have a port number
    specified.
  <DT>GrecsrvRunning (boolean)<DD>If true, jobs will assume that the GPU
    reconstruction server software is already running.  Otherwise, jobs will
    start and stop the GPU reconstruction server software.  If not set, this
    property defaults to be false.
  <DT>GrecsrvUseProcessControl (boolean)<DD>If true, jobs will use the
    mechanism described by the ProcessControl property to determine the hosts
    that will run the GPU reconstruction server software and the mechanism
    for starting the software.  If false, jobs will use the hosts listed
    by the GrecsrvHosts property and will use the login command set by the
    DefaultLoginCommand property to start the server on those hosts.  If not
    set, this property defaults to be true.
  <DT>ProcessControl<DD>Defines how parallel jobs that start their own
    child processes determine where the processes should run and implement
    the procedure of starting the child process.  Three values are currently
    understood:  "simple", "mpich-machines", and "openmpi".  "simple" means
    that all the processes should be started on the same host as the parent
    process.  "mpich-machines" means that the job will be passed a text file,
    in the same format as used by MPICH for its machines files, listing the
    hosts to use.  The job will also be passed the command to use to log in to
    other hosts.  The DefaultBackgroundLoginOption, DefaultLoginCommand,
    DefaultMachinesFiles, and DefaultNodeCheckCommand properties are useful
    for systems or queues that use "mpich-machines" for ProcessControl.
    "openmpi" means that the job will be passed how to invoke OpenMPI's
    (version 1.3 or later) mpirun or mpiexec and should use that when starting
    processes.  The DefaultMPIRunCommand is useful for systems or queues that
    use "openmpi" for ProcessControl.
  <DT>StatusCommand (character string)<DD>Holds the command line to query
    the system's status for display in the graphical user interface.
</DL>

<P>The queue properties with special meaning include all the host properties
and the following properties:

<DL>
  <DT>AcceptsCluster (boolean)<DD>Indicates whether or not the queue accepts
    parallel jobs that may run on multiple hosts.  If this property is not
    set for a queue, the default value is true.
  <DT>AcceptsGPU (boolean)<DD>Indicates whether or not the queue accepts
    GPU-accelerated jobs.  If this property is not set for a queue, the default
    value is false.
  <DT>AcceptsSerial (boolean)<DD>Indicates whether or not the queue accepts
    serial (single-processor) jobs.  If this property is not set for a queue,
    the default value is true.
  <DT>AcceptsThreaded (boolean)<DD>Indicates whether or not the queue accepts
    parallel jobs that run on a single host.  If this property is not set for
    a queue, the default value is true.
  <DT>Name (character string)<DD>Holds the name of the queue as will appear
    in the menus for selecting queues.
  <DT>SetProcessorCountForApp (boolean)<DD>If true the requested number of
    processors is passed to the application.  If false, the requested number
    of processors is only passed to the command given by SubmissionCommand.
    When not set, this property defaults to be true.
  <DT>SubmissionCommand (character string)<DD>Holds the command necessary for
    submitting a job to the queue.  The command followed by white space
    followed by the name of the script or executable to run must work to
    start a job.  Occurrences of %p in the command will be replaced by the
    number of processors to use.  Occurrences of %% in the command will be
    replaced by a single % character.
</DL>

<H3>Queue Environment Variables</H3>
<P>If you use environment variables rather than a configuration file to
specify the queues, the environment variables QUE1, QUE2, ..., QUE10 set the
names of the batch queues.  The command to submit a task to a queue can be
set in one of two ways.  To set a command specific to a single queue, use
the QUECOM1, ..., or QUECOM10 variables.  The command combined with the
name of the command file (for instance,

<PRE>
            $QUECOM1 script.com
</PRE>

<P>) is what is used when submitting a task.  Use the QCOMMAND environment
variable to set a command for all queues that do not have a specific command
set. When QCOMMAND is used,

<PRE>
            $QCOMMAND &lt;name of queue&gt; &lt;name of script file&gt;
</PRE>

<P>is what is used when submitting a task.

<P>By default, jobs are run on the local machine.  If you want one of the
queues to be used by default for single processor jobs, set the QDEFAULT
environment variable to the number of the queue which is to be the default
destination.  A value of QDEFAULT which is not between one and ten will set
the default destination to the local machine.

<P>The commands used to run the application are written to the file listed
in the <EM>ComFile</EM> field.  If you intend to run multiple jobs
at once (for instance if you are submitting multiple jobs to batch queues),
you should change the name of the command file for each one so that you don't
overwrite the commands for a previous job that may not have completed.  It
would also be a good idea to change the name of the
<A HREF="#logfile">log file</A> for each job as well.
