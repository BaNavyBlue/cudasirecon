<H1><A NAME="WMStcArrDialogSimple">Editing Lists Interface</A></H1>
<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>Some Priism applications use a common user interface for editing a list
of items and the individual characteristics of the items in the list.  The
dialog will display a portion of the list at a time.  This portion of the
interface varies from application to application but typically has one item
and its characteristics per line in the dialog.

<P>At the bottom of the dialog there are controls to navigate through
the list.  The leftmost arrow control will shift the view of the list to show
the first element in the list.  The next arrow control shifts the view of
the list to show the elements just prior to the ones currently in view.
The other two arrow controls are similar but move forward in the list.
Between the controls is a field where you can enter the number of the item in
the list to which you would like to jump.

<P>Changes made to the items in the list are not immediately passed to the
application; buttons at the bottom of the dialog control when information
is passed to the application.  The <EM>Ok</EM> button will pass all current
changes to the application and closes the dialog; the <EM>Save</EM> button
is the same but keeps the dialog open.  The <EM>Cancel</EM> button undoes
all changes since the last save and closes the dialog; the <EM>Undo</EM>
button is the same but keeps the dialog open.  The navigation controls
(the arrow buttons and the field to jump to an element) all implicitly save
values before shifting the view of the list.
