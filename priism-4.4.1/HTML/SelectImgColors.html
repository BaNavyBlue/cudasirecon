<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>Use <EM>Select Image Colors</EM> to specify how the image data is
displayed in an image window. Images can either be displayed one wavelength
at a time in pseudocolor or as one to three wavelengths simultaneously
using RGB mode.

<P>Pseudocolor shows a single wavelength in false color.  The colors are
shades of grey by default; you can change the palette with the "Change
Lookup Table" menu in Priism's color menu.  The number of colors used is
typically 240 to 256, depending on the hardware.  Because of the way the
eye reacts to colors, you may be able to see more detail in an image when
looking at it in pseudocolor mode.

<P>RGB mode shows each wavelength as shades of red, green, blue, or a
blended color (cyan = green + blue, yellow = red + green, or purple =
red + blue).  A maximum of 3 wavelengths can be displayed simultaneously
using the simple colors red, green, and blue. If a blended color is used,
a maximum of 2 wavelengths can be displayed simultaneously.  The colors can
only be combined so that red, green and blue are assigned once each. For
example, if cyan is being used for one wavelength, the only color left to
display an additional wavelength is red.

<P>When the monitor is in <EM>RGB</EM> mode, you can use these option
menus (one per wavelength) to select the color used to represent each
wavelength.

<P>SelectImgColors has a command line interface so that you can automate the
process of changing the image colors for an image window.  The basic syntax
for invoking SelectImgColors is this: <CODE>SelectImgColors</CODE>
<VAR>window_number</VAR> <VAR>options</VAR>.  The options currently understood
are listed below.  If you do not specify any options after the window number,
you'll get the graphical
user interface.

<DL>
  <DT><CODE>-colors=</CODE><VAR>color0</VAR>[<CODE>:</CODE><VAR>color1</VAR>...]
  <DD>Sets the colors used to display each wavelength when the image window
    is in the true color display mode.  Specify the colors by providing a list
    of color names separated by colons.  The first color in the list will be
    used for the first wavelength, the second color will be used for the second
    wavelength, and so on.  The allowed color names, which are
    case-insensitive, are black, blue, cyan, green, purple, red, and yellow.
    You may omit the color name for a wavelength to use the currently assigned
    color for the wavelength.  If you do omit a color, do not omit the
    separating colons.  For instance, <CODE>-colors=::green</CODE> keeps the
    currently assigned colors for the first two wavelengths, assigns green
    to the third wavelength, and, if the image window has more than three
    wavelengths, retains the current colors for the remaining wavelengths.  If
    there are colors that overlap (for instance red and purple), the
    overlapping color components are removed as follows:
    <OL>
      <LI>If wavelengths <VAR>i</VAR> and <VAR>j</VAR> have colors assigned
        by <CODE>-colors</CODE>, the overlapping components will be removed
        from the color assigned to the higher wavelength index.
      <LI>If wavelength <VAR>i</VAR> has a color assigned by
        <CODE>-colors</CODE> that overlaps with the color of wavelength
        <VAR>j</VAR> which was not set with <CODE>-colors</CODE>, the
        overlapping color components will be removed from the color assigned to
        wavelength <VAR>j</VAR>.
      <LI>If wavelengths <VAR>i</VAR> and <VAR>j</VAR> have overlapping colors
        that were not assigned by by <CODE>-colors</CODE>, the overlapping
        components will be removed from the color assigned to the higher
        wavelength index.
    </OL>

  <DT><CODE>-map=</CODE><VAR>on0</VAR>[<CODE>:</CODE><VAR>on1</VAR>...]
  <DD>Sets which wavelengths are displayed.  Specify whether each wavelength is
    on or off by providing a list of ones and zeros separated by colons.  A
    value of zero turns off display of a wavelength, and a value of one turns
    on display of a wavelength.  The first value in the list will be applied to
    the first wavelength, the second value of the second wavelength, and so on.
    You may omit a value for a wavelength to not change whether that wavelength
    is mapped.  If you do omit a value, do not omit the separating colons.
    For instance, <CODE>-map=:1::0</CODE> turns on display of the second
    wavelength, turns off display of the fourth wavelength, and keeps the other
    wavelengths as they are.  If the image window uses the pseudocolor display
    mode (either because you use the <CODE>-pseudo</CODE> option or because the
    image window was already in the pseudocolor mode and you did not use
    <CODE>-rgb</CODE>), the <CODE>-map</CODE> option will cause the image
    window to display the first wavelength that is turned on.  For instance,
    <CODE>-map=0::0:1</CODE> will cause a pseudocolor window to display the
    fourth wavelength unless the second wavelength is currently displayed.  If
    the image window uses true color display mode, SelectImgColors will
    silently ignore attempts to display wavelengths that are displayed in
    black.

  <DT><CODE>-pseudo</CODE>
  <DD>Causes the image window to switch to the pseudocolor mode where one
    wavelength is displayed per image and the image is colored according
    to the currently loaded color lookup table.
  
  <DT><CODE>-query</CODE>
  <DD>Prints out the current wavelength coloring and mapping attributes for the
    image window to standard output.  The printed report consists of several
    lines, each starting with the name (a combination of digits and lower- or
    uppercase characters) of the attribute, followed immediately by a colon,
    followed by the attribute's values which are separated from the color and
    each other by white space.  The attributes currently printed are
    DisplayMode, WavelengthColors, and MappedWavelengths.  For DisplayMode,
    the value will be pseudocolor, rgb, or an integer for an unknown display
    type.  For WavelengthColors, there will be five color names each of which
    will be black, blue, cyan, green, purple, red, yellow, white, or an integer
    for an unknown color.  For MappedWavelengths, there will be 5 values.
    Each of those values will either be yes or no indicating whether or not
    the wavelength is mapped.

  <DT><CODE>-rgb</CODE>
  <DD>Causes the image window to switch to the true color mode where up to
    three wavelengths are displayed per image with each wavelength rendered
    in a different color.
</DL>

<P>As an example,

<PRE>
    SelectImgColors 3 -rgb -colors=blue:black:green:red:black -map=1:0:1:1:0
</PRE>

<P>would switch window 3 to a true color display with the first, third, and
fourth wavelengths displayed.  The first wavelength will be rendered in blue,
the third in green, and the fourth in red.
