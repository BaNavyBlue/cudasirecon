<H1>Installation Requirements for Priism 4 on Mac OS X</H1>

<H2>Operating system</H2>
<P>The software includes both 32 and 64-bit components.  The 32-bit version
should be compatible with Intel systems running Mac OS X 10.4.4 or later.  The
64-bit version should be compatiable with Intel systems running Mac OS X 10.5
or later.  From Priism 4.4.0 on, Priism does not run PowerPC systems.

<H2>Required libraries and additional software</H2>
<DL>
  <DT>X<DD>It is necessary to have the X libraries installed
    (libXt.6.dylib (compatibility version 6.0.0), libXext.6.dylib
    (compatibility version 6.4.0), libXi.6.dylib (compatibility
    version 6.0.0), libX11.6.dylib (compatibility version 6.2.0),
    libSM.6.dylib (compatibility version 6.0.0), and libICE.6.dylib
    (compatibility version 6.3.0) are used; on Intel systems
    libXft.2.dylib (compatibility version 2.1.0) and
    libXrender.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.2.0) are
    also used).  For OS X 10.5 through 10.7, Apple's X11 provides those
    libraries.  For later versions of OS X, install XQuartz which is available
    from <A HREF="https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/Releases">https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/Releases</A> (you can also use XQuartz on
    OS X 10.5 through 10.7; XQuartz 2.6.3 is the last XQuartz release with
    support for OS X 10.5).  Priism expects the libraries to be in
    /usr/X11R6/lib; if they are not there you may need to set the
    DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable so that they can be found
    (the dyld man page explains DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH).  There are some
    unresolved problems running Priism with newer versions of the X libraries;
    search the list of
    <A HREF="Limitations.html">known limitations</A> for "OS X" to know what
    problems to expect.
  <DT>OpenGL/Mesa<DD>To use the components with graphical interfaces,
    it is necessary to have OpenGL libraries (or their Mesa equivalents)
    installed which can perform the rendering in conjunction with the X server
    (libGL.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.2.0) is used).  Apple's X11 or
    XQuartz provides those libraries.  As with the X libraries, the OpenGL
    libraries are expected to be in /usr/X11R6/lib.
</DL>

<H2>Optional libraries and additional software</H2>
<DL>
  <DT>Matlab<DD>Priism includes the ImgToMat and MatToImg tools to convert
    Priism image files to and from Matlab's .mat files.  To use those
    converters, you'll have to have Matlab 7.
</DL>

<H2>Optional Hardware</H2>
<P>The GPU-accelerated calculations for EM tomography require an x86 or
x86_64 Linux system with an appropriate NVIDIA graphics card.  That system
does not need to be the as the system where you run Priism. The
<A HREF="EMCAT/Parallel.html#GPUParallel">"GPU Parallel Settings" section of EMCAT/Parallel.html</A>
describes the hardware and software requirements for the GPU-accelerated
calculations in more detail.

<H2>Disk space</H2>
<P>During installation, you will need space for the downloaded archive
and the uncompressed files; the uncompressed files do not need to be on the
same disk as the downloaded archive.  Once the software is installed, the
downloaded archive may be deleted.  The space required is 135 megabytes during
installation and 100 megabytes afterwards.

<P>While the software is running, it makes extensive use of a shared memory
file and related temporary files.  The amount of space needed for these
files depends on the size of the data sets loaded, but a minimal configuration
should have 200 megabytes of space available for these files and having
approximately 500 megabytes of space available would be better. 
<A HREF="PriismInstallation.html#Step4">Step 4</A> of the installation
procedure describes how the default location for the shared memory and
temporary files is set in the sample setup scripts.
