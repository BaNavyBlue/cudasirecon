<H1>Extended Header Format for Data from UCSF Tomography</H1>
<P><A HREF="">UCSF Tomography</A> stores its collected data in a
<A HREF="IM_ref2.html#Introduction">variant of the MRC format</A> with an
extended header that has thirty-two floating-point values for each image.  The
first thirteen of the thirty-two values, in the order that the appear, are:

<OL>
  <LI>The value is the tilt angle, in degrees, about the first axis.
  <LI>The value is the tilt angle, in degrees, about the second axis.
  <LI>The value is the x stage position in microns.
  <LI>The value is the y stage position in microns.
  <LI>The value is the z stage position in microns.
  <LI>The value is the x image shift, in pixels, applied by the electron
    optics.
  <LI>The value is the y image shift, in pixels, applied by the electron
    optics.
  <LI>The value is the nominal defocus, in microns.
  <LI>The value is the exposure time in seconds.
  <LI>The value is the mean intensity value, in image counts, across the image.
  <LI>The value is the apparent orientation of the first tilt axis in the
    image.  It is measured in degrees.  If the image is displayed so that the
    first sample is in the lower left and the last sample is in the upper
    right, a value of zero degrees for the orientation corresponds to a tilt
    axis parallel to the vertical axis of the image.  A positive value for the
    orientation angle rotates the axis counterclockwise from the vertical
    direction and a clockwise rotation of the image is necessary to make the
    tilt axis vertical.
  <LI>The value is the apparent pixel spacing, at the sample, in angstroms.
  <LI>The value is the magnification of the microscope.  Normally this will be
    the calibrated value for the magnification: multiplying the image pixel
    spacing by the magnification should give the physical pixel spacing for the
    camera.  
</OL>

<P>UCSF Tomography does not currently use the remaining nineteen values.
