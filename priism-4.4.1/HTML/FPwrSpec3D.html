<H1><A NAME="FPwrSpec3D">3D Power Spectrum</A></H1>
<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>The program estimates the 3D power spectra for each x, y, and z (or time)
input volume by performing one or more forward transforms, finding their
squared magnitudes, and averaging the results.  This can then be smoothed if
desired.  The output is the square root of the power at each frequency.

<P>The controls in the user interface include a
<A HREF="Region.html">standard set of controls</A> for selecting the input
file, output file, and region of interest and for starting and interrupting
processing.  The other controls are organized as follows:

<UL>
  <LI>Use the <A HREF="#SwapZT">toggle button labeled "Swap z/time"</A> to
    select the third dimension for processing.  When the toggle button is off,
    blocks in x, y, and z are processed.  When the toggle button is on,
    blocks in x, y, and time are processed.
  <LI>Use the <A HREF="#Preprocessing">button labeled "Set preprocessing"</A>
    to display and change the parameters which control the processing of the
    data before it is split into blocks and transformed.  By default, no
    preprocessing is done.
  <LI>Use the <A HREF="#Averaging/Smoothing">button labeled
    "Set averaging/smoothing"</A> to open a dialog with the settings for
    how many blocks a 3D input region is broken into and how much smoothing
    is applied to the average result.
  <LI>Use the <A HREF="#Window">button labeled "Set window/taper"</A> to select
    a function used to smooth out discontinuities at the edges of the data
    after it has been preprocessed and split into blocks.  By default, no
    smoothing is done.
  <LI>Use the <A HREF="#OutputFormat">button labeled "Set output format"</A>
    to open a dialog with controls for the form of the output:  whether or
    not the log of the square root of the power is taken, and whether or not
    the result is shifted to center the zero frequency component.
</UL>

<P>There are a couple things to note about this application:

<UL>
  <LI>The pixel format for the output is always floating-point reals.
  <LI>For pixel spacings are nxs / (nx * dx), nys / (ny * dy), and
    nzs / (nz * dz) where nx, ny, and nz are the dimensions, in pixels,
    of the block transformed, dx, dy, and dz are the input pixel spacings,
    and nxs, nys, and nzs are the dimensions of the smoothing box in pixels.
    When time rather than z is used as the third dimension, the z pixel
    spacing from the input file is retained.
  <LI>The start indices in the header are set to zero.  The coordinates
    for the origin are set to zero if the zero frequency is not centered;
    otherwise, they are set to the most negative frequencies present, in
    units of the output pixel spacing.  When time rather than z is used as
    the third dimension, the z starting index and z origin from the input file
    are retained.
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="SwapZT">Swap Z/Time</A></H2>
<P>The three dimensions used in a transform can either be x, y, and z or
x, y, and time.  When the toggle button labeled "Swap z/time" is off, the
program uses x, y, and z as the dimensions to transform.  When that toggle
button is on, the program uses x, y, and time as the dimensions to transform.
When you select a new input file, the program will automatically select
the dimension to use as the third dimension.  If the file has more than one
z section or only one time point, the program will use the z dimension as
the third dimension; otherwise, it will use the time dimension as the third
dimension.

<H2><A NAME="Preprocessing">Preprocessing</A></H2>
<P>The input region can be processed to remove an offset or trend before
the data is broken into blocks, tapered, and transformed.  To display
the controls for this processing, press the button labeled
<EM>Set preprocessing</EM> in the main dialog.  There are five types of
processing that can be done; select one by pressing the appropriate toggle
in the dialog.  The processing options are:

<DL>
  <DT>None<DD>The input is not modified before the data is split into
    blocks, tapered, and transformed.
  <DT>Subtract offset<DD>The specified value is subtracted from all the input
    values.
  <DT>Subtract mean<DD>For each 3D input region, the mean of the region
    is subtracted from all values in the region.
  <DT>Remove linear trend<DD>An average slope for each 3D input region
    is estimated by averaging values from the first and last third of each
    dimension; the linear trend corresponding to that average slope and
    the mean of the region is subtracted from the input data.  The algorithm
    used is the average slope method extended to three dimensions (Digital data
    analysis procedures, Bendat and Piersol, 1st Edition, 1971, page 288).
  <DT>Remove trends up to order<DD>A polynomial of the given order is fit to
    each 3D input region.  That polynomial evaluated at each input point
    is then subtracted from the input before the data is split into blocks,
    tapered, and transformed.
</DL>

<P>If you are intending to taper the data and the data does not already have
a zero mean, you should consider using the mean subtraction, linear trend
removal, or polynomial fit options.

<H2><A NAME="Averaging/Smoothing">Averaging/Smoothing</A></H2>
<P>This application provides two ways to reduce the variance of the
spectra estimate:  breaking the input region into blocks which are
handled separately and then averaged and smoothing of the spectra.

<P>Breaking the input into blocks is controlled by the parameters of the
top half of the dialog opened with the <EM>Set averaging/smoothing</EM>
button.  The inputs are the x, y, and z (or time) sizes in pixels for each
block, the percent of the block that overlaps with the block to the left, to
the bottom, and beneath the current block, and the number of blocks in x, y,
and z (or time).  When the <EM>Automatically adjust for best coverage</EM>
toggle is on, changing the overlap or size will cause the count to be adjusted
so there is as many blocks as possible, and when the number of blocks is
adjusted, the size will be changed so that it is an efficiently handled size
and as much of the input region is covered as possible.  When the toggle is
off, the size, overlap, and count can be varied independently within the
constraint that the blocks must all fit in the input region.  When breaking the
input into blocks, a common approach is to fully <A HREF="#Window">taper</A>
each block and have a 50% overlap.

<P>The amount of smoothing done is set in the <EM>Size</EM> field at the
bottom of the dialog.  Each output pixel is the summation of the unsmoothed
result over a block of the size shown.  The size in each direction must be
a positive odd integer.  To ensure that a purely real input results in
a spectra with the correct symmetry about the origin, choose the smoothing
size for a dimension such that

<PRE>
  (floor(n / 2) - floor(s / 2) + s - 1) / s
</PRE>

<P>is even where n is the block size in that dimension.

<H2><A NAME="Window">Window/taper</A></H2>
<P>Applying a windowing function, also called tapering, multiplies the
data by a function which goes to zero (or near zero) at the edges of the
data.  This is done after preprocessing and splitting the data into blocks
to remove discontinuities at the edges which can complicate the
interpretation of frequency spectra; the disadvantage of applying a window
is that it essentially throws away parts of the input and it broadens
features in the spectra.  The former problem can be alleviated by overlapping
the blocks that are transformed.

<P>The windowing functions used are separable, i.e, the windowing function,
W(x,y,z), can be written as the product of WX(x), WY(y), and WZ(z).  WX, WY,
and WZ are calculated from the same formula but with different inputs for
the number of pixels, n, and the fraction, f, of the dimension that is
attenuated by the windowing function.  The three values in the
<EM>Coverage</EM> field are the values of f divided by two for the x, y,
and z (or time) directions, respectively.  Commonly used values for the
coverage are 0.5 (a "full taper") and 0.1 (a 10% taper).  The power, x, is
used by half-sine windowing function.

<P>The functions used to calculate the windowing functions are shown below.
i is the pixel index and runs from 0 to n minus 1, and e is given by

<PRE>

<P>The output spectra is scaled so that summing over the spectra gives an
estimate of the variance of the input data.  By default the frequencies are
ordered so that zero frequency is at (0, 0, 0) and positive Nyquist frequency
in both directions is located at (nx/2, ny/2, nz/2) where nx, ny, and nz are
the sizes of a block.  Use the button labeled <EM>Set output format</EM> in
the main dialog to open a dialog with controls that allow modifications
to the default format.  The available options are:

accepts the options shown below (optional parts are shown in brackets).  If
mutually exclusive options (i.e. for selection of the windowing function),
the last option that appears on the command line takes precedence.  The
default is to calculate the square root of the power spectrum without any
preprocessing, no tapering of the data, and no averaging or smoothing.

<DL>
  <DT><CODE>-3d=z</CODE> or <CODE>-3d=t</CODE>
  <DD>Selects which dimension to use as the third dimension for processing.
    The first form selects the z dimension as the third dimension; the second
    form selects the time dimension as the third dimension.  If you do not
    specify either form, the program uses the z dimension as the third
    dimension when the input file has multiple z sections per time point or
    only one time point.  Otherwise, the program uses the time dimension as
    the third dimension for filtering.

  <DT><CODE>-subtract=</CODE><VAR>value</VAR> or <CODE>-subtract=mean</CODE>
  <DD>Specifies that the input data should be preprocessed by subtracting
    <VAR>value</VAR> or the mean.

  <DT><CODE>-linear_detrend</CODE>
  <DD>Specifies that the input data should be preprocessed by subtracting the
    linear trend which corresponds to the estimated average slope.

  <DT><CODE>-polyfit=</CODE><VAR>n</VAR>
  <DD>Specifies that the input data should be preprocessed by subtracting
    the least-squares fit polynomial of order <VAR>n</VAR>.  Valid values
    of <VAR>n</VAR> range from one to 10.

  <DT><CODE>-block_size=</CODE><VAR>nx</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>ny</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>nz</VAR>
  <DD>Specifies the dimensions of the blocks which are extracted from
    the preprocessed input region, used as the source of the spectra
    calculation, and then averaged.  The default is to use a block the
    size of the input region.

  <DT><CODE>-block_overlap=</CODE><VAR>x_overlap</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>y_overlap</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>z_overlap</VAR>
  <DD>Specifies the overlap, in percent, of the blocks.  The default is
    to not overlap the blocks.

  <DT><CODE>-block_count=</CODE><VAR>nx</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>ny</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>nz</VAR>
  <DD>Specifies the number of blocks in the various dimensions.  The default
    is to use one block.

  <DT><CODE>-smooth_size=</CODE><VAR>nx</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>ny</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>nz</VAR>
  <DD>Specifies the size of the smoothing filter applied to the spectra
    after averaging over the blocks.  <VAR>nx</VAR>, <VAR>ny</VAR>, and
    <VAR>nz</VAR> must be odd positive integers.  The default is to use a
    smoothing filter with dimensions of one, equivalent to no smoothing at all.

    exponent, which controls the sharpness of the window edges.

  <DT><CODE>-halfsine_power=</CODE><VAR>p</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the exponent for the half-sine windowing function.  This option is
    ignored when other windowing functions are used.  If this option is not
