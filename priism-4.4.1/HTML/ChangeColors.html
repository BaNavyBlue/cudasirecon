<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>This application allows you to change the colors that are used for
overlay graphics on the image window.

<P>The RGB values and names for the overlay colors are displayed in a list and
can be edited by hand.  You can also select a color from the color wheel.
To do this, depress the toggle button for the graphic color you want to
edit.  Then click in the color wheel to select the color; the selected
color will be displayed as a bar below the wheel.  To adjust the brightness
of the color, slide and release the <EM>shade</EM> slider.  When you're
satisfied with the color, press the <EM>apply color</EM> button to update
the RGB values in the list of overlay colors.

<P>Depressing the <EM>Accept Colors</EM> button causes the current colors
to be applied.  If you want to use the same set of colors in later Priism
sessions, use the <EM>Save Colors to File</EM> to save the settings which
can then be restored with <EM>Retrieve Colors from File</EM>.  If you follow
a <A HREF="#filename">simple convention</A>, you will be able to select your
edited colors from the Priism preferences dialog.

<P>The <EM>Save Colors to File</EM> brings up a dialog in which you
enter the filename for the colors file.  If a path is not specified,
the file is written to the directory from which Priism was started.

<P>To make your colors file available in the Priism preferences dialog,
the file needs to have the <EM>.colors</EM> extension and be located
in the <EM>.iveprefs</EM> directory in your home directory (if this
directory does not exist, you'll need to create it).
