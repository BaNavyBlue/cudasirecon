<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>Use Movie to view image data in a window as a sequence of movie frames.
This can be particularly useful when looking at volume-rendered data or
a sequence of time points. When you activate Movie from the main Priism menu,
all windows that are open and not currently iconified when Movie starts can
be controlled by that instance of the Movie tool. If you activate Movie from
the View menu of an individual image window, only that window will be
controlled by the Movie tool.

<H2><A NAME="Windows">Window list</A></H2>
<P>When you launch Movie from the main Priism menu, the Movie dialog will
have the list of the windows it will control at the top of the dialog.  This
scrolled list has one line per window; windows that only have a single time
point and z section are never included.  Each line will display the window
number followed by the z and time point sizes.  If Movie is actively
controlling that window (i.e. when animation is in progress, Movie changes the
currently displayed section in that window), the z and time point bounds for
the animation are also shown.  The bounds are displayed as three values
separated by colons:  the first value is the starting index, the second value
is the largest allowed index, and the third value is the increment.  During an
animation, Movie automatically updates the list to correspond to size changes
in the windows or windows which have been closed.  You can force the Movie
tool to rebuild the list by using the "Update" button, which is further
described below.

<P>To change the bounds or active/inactive state for a window, select the
line for that window in the list or enter the window number entry directly
in the Window field just below the list.  Then use the
<A HREF="#Z">"Z Start/End/Inc" field</A> to edit the z bounds, the
<A HREF="#Time">"Time Start/End/Inc" field</A> to edit the time point bounds,
or the toggle button labeled "active" to switch between the active and inactive
states.

<P>Four other buttons affect all windows in the list:

<DL>
  <DT>Update<DD>If you press this button, located immediately above the
    scrolled list, the Movie tool will reexamine all available windows
    and update the list.  In the process, it will add or remove entries in
    the list corresponding to windows that have been opened or closed since
    the last time the list was updated.  For windows that were in the list
    previously, the Movie tool will attempt to preserve the current bounds,
    but if the size of the window has changed, the Movie tool will coerce the
    bounds as necessary.  The Movie tool will reset the active/inactive state
    of each window:  if the window is not iconified it will be active; if it
    is iconified it will be inactive.  During the update of the list, the
    Movie tool will also reset the animation to start at the first section.
  <DT>Copy range<DD>Copies the z and time point bounds for the currently
    selected window to all other windows (coercing them if necessary if the
    another window has a smaller size).
  <DT>Activate all<DD>Puts all windows in the list under active control of the
    Movie tool.
  <DT>Inactivate all<DD>Causes the Movie tool to cease active control of all
    windows in the list.

<H2><A NAME="Z">Z</A></H2>
<P>Using these text fields, you can specify the starting and ending z section
for the animation and the section index increment.

<H2><A NAME="Time">Time</A></H2>
<P>For time lapse data, you can specify a subset of the time points to
view by choosing a starting and ending time point and the time index increment.

<H2><A NAME="ManualZControl">Manual Z Control</A></H2>
<P>If you are animating time lapse data, you can use this slider control to
change the Z section.  This slider control will be grayed out when the
<A HREF="#TimeLapse">"Time Lapse" toggle button</A> is off.

<P><A HREF="#Movie">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="TimeLapse">Time Lapse</A></H2>
<P>Toggle this button on if you want to animate through time instead of z.

<H2><A NAME="Loop">Loop</A></H2>
<P>The "Up&Down", "Up", and, "Down" toggles control how to move through the
data.  When the "Up" toggle is on, the z (or time) index is increased to its
maximum value and then the animation starts over at the starting z (or time)
value.  When the "Down" toggle is on the section index is decreased to its
minimum value and then the animation repeats.  When the "Up & Down" toggle is
on, the z (time) index is first increased to its maximum value and then
decreased to the minimum.

<H2><A NAME="RepeatDelay">Z Delay</A></H2>
<P>This lets you adjust how much time to pause between repeating the display
of a sequence of frames.  It has no effect in the up and down mode.

<H2><A NAME="FrameSpeed">Speed</A></H2>
<P>This slider lets you adjust how quickly the frames are displayed. When set
to the minimum value, the frames will be displayed as fast as possible.

<H2><A NAME="Paused">Pause</A></H2>
<P>This toggle button determines whether or not Movie animates the image
windows.  Toggle the "Pause" button off to start the movie.
