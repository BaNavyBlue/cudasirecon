<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>EditPolygon lets you create 2D polygons in the image window to identify
objects in the image. These polygons are used to delineate areas of the
data for measurements, for cutting out part of the image, or as building
blocks for 3D Objects which can be used for 3D measurement and modeling.
EditPolygon provides interactive and automatic creation of polygons and
editing of existing polygons. There are other programs that can generate
polygons: <A HREF="2DObjFinder.html">2DObjFinder</A> automatically creates
polygons from a binary mask and <A HREF="FPPolygons.html">FPPolygons</A>
functions similarly but operates on data where each pixel value is a region
number.  Programs that use polygons are <A HREF="CutMask.html">CutMask</A>,
which masks out the data either inside or outside the polygons,
<A HREF="VolumeBuilder.html">Volume Builder</A>, which associates polygons
into three-dimensional objects, and <A HREF="FindPoints.html">Find Points</A>,
which can use polygons to mark regions of interest to search for point-like
intensity features.  All of these programs can look at the same set of
polygons so that they can be used together.  When any of one of these programs
are running and have a set of polygons loaded into an image window, any other
one will see those polygons and be able to work with them.

  <LI>Enter the image window number for the image that you wish to use for
    editing or creating polygons.
  <LI>If you want to edit an existing polygon data set, enter the name
    of the polygon data set in the field next to the <EM>polygon data</EM>
    button or press the <EM>polygon data</EM> button to open a file selection
    dialog to choose the file.
  <LI>Create polygons by clicking in the image where you want the vertices
    of the polygons to lie.  To complete the polygon press the
    space bar while the mouse pointer is over the image or press the
    <EM>Close Polygon</EM> button in the EditPolygon dialog.
  <LI>Now that you've gone through the work of tracing some object by hand,
    read the <A HREF="#Action_Mode">action mode section</A> to learn
    about how to modify existing polygons or semiautomatically creating
    new ones.
  <LI>When you are finished creating or editing polygons, you can save
    the polygons to a file by pressing the <EM>Save .POL File</EM> button
    in the EditPolygon dialog.  You can also just leave the EditPolygon
    program running and start the program that you want to use the polygons.
    Point that program at the window with the polygons and it will use the
    polygons that EditPolygon loaded into that window. The polygons will stay
    loaded in the window as long as one of the polygon manipulation programs
    is using them.

<H2><A NAME="Wave_Mode">Wave Mode</A></H2>
<P>If you are working with multiple wave data, you can always be sure of
which wave you are modeling in, by setting the active wave toggles.  If
you are in black and white mode in the image, it's easy, because the wave
that is displayed is the one you are modeling.  In this case, polygons that
are actually applied to a section will be red.  In RGB mode, the current
wave is not obvious in the window so you are more dependent on the toggles
in the EditPolygon menu.  In this case polygons will be different colors
for the different waves so you can distinguish which is from which wave.
The colors are controllable using <A HREF="SelectGrColors.html">Graphics
Colors</A> from the <EM>Options</EM> menu on the image window.
There you can set the colors for each wave to be whatever you want.  The
option menu for the active wave mode provides a shortcut for modeling in
data with multiple waves.  If it is set to <EM>one</EM>, then the polygons
you create will only be applied to the currently active wave.  If it is set to
<EM>all</EM>, then all the polygons created while in this mode will be applied
to all of the waves.

<P>The action mode option menu contains the choices for what will happen when
you click in the image window using the mouse.  The possible actions are:

<DL>
  <DT><STRONG>Add</STRONG><DD>Clicking in the image window will add a
    point to the currently open polygon in that section or create a new
    polygon and add the point clicked as the first vertex.  When the last
    point is picked for a polygon, press the space bar while the mouse
    is over the image window or press the <EM>Close Polygon</EM> button
    in the EditPolygon dialog to close the polygon.
  <DT><STRONG>Modify</STRONG><DD>Allows changes to be made to the positions of
    individual vertices.  Pressing and holding the left mouse button while
    the pointer is near a vertex selects that vertex, and until the left
    mouse button is released, the vertex's position will change as the mouse
    is moved.
  <DT><STRONG>Roam</STRONG><DD>Allows whole polygons to be shifted.
    Pressing and holding the left mouse button while the pointer is inside
    a polygon selects that polygon, and until the left mouse button is
    released, motions of the mouse will cause the polygon to translate.
  <DT><STRONG>Select</STRONG><DD>Clicking inside a polygon causes it to
    be the current selection.  The currently selected polygon is highlighted,
    and may have operations performed on it by pressing one of the following
    keys when the pointer is in the image window:
    <DL>
      <DT>a<DD>Deletes the selected polygon.
      <DT>f<DD>Smoothes the jagged edges of the polygon one at a time starting
        with the worst.
      <DT>g<DD>Deselects the polygon.
      <DT>s<DD>Smoothes the jagged edges all at once; currently,
        smoothing just means putting the very wrong point in between its two
        adjacent points.
    </DL>
    Note that when a new polygon is created via the Auto action or when
    a manually-created polygon is closed, that polygon becomes the current
    selection and the actions described above can be applied without
    entering the selection mode.  While in the selection mode the <EM>d</EM>
    key for deleting the last polygon in a section is disabled to avoid
    it being mistakenly used when deleting the currently selected polygon
    was intended.  The smoothing keys are most useful for polygons generated
    via the Auto action.  
  <DT><STRONG>Auto</STRONG><DD>Clicking in the image window causes the
    point selected to be used as the starting point for automatically
    generating a polygon.  While in the Auto mode, a dialog is displayed
    which controls how the polygons are generated in relation to the
    starting point.  The <A HREF="#Auto_Polygon">AutoPolygon</A> topic
    discusses the available options in more detail.
  <DT><STRONG>Off</STRONG><DD>Clicking in the image window has no
    effect on EditPolygon.  This is useful if you wish to use the
    mouse for actions in other programs without having an effect
    on EditPolygon.

<H2><A NAME="Test_Section">Test Section</A></H2>
<P>When the <EM>test section</EM> toggle is on, you can create polygons that
will be shown in all sections as you move through the sections but which will
not be applied to the section unless you press the <EM>apply test section</EM>
button or press <EM>t</EM> while the pointer is in the image window.  Polygons
in the test section are displayed in green; when they are copied to the
polygon list for the current section they are displayed in the normal color
used for polygons (red for pseudocolor mode or the current color for the
wave's graphics for RGB mode).  If you want to add, delete or modify
a polygon that is not in the test section, turn off the <EM>test section</EM>
toggle so that the actions are applied to the polygons in the real sections.
The next time you want to work with the test section, toggle the
<EM>test section</EM> toggle back on and the polygons that were in the test
section will appear again and can still be used.  If you want to delete the
polygons in the test section, use <EM>Clear Test Section</EM> from the
<A HREF="#Edit_Options">edit options menu</A> or, while the
<EM>test section</EM> toggle is on and the pointer is in the image window,
press the <EM>d</EM> key repeatedly until the all the polygons are deleted.
You can also enter the <A HREF="#Action_Mode">select action mode</A> to select
a polygon from the test section and then press the <EM>a</EM> key to delete
it. You may want to use test section to make sure you have a polygon or
polygons that are good for a number of sections.  When you've got the right
polygon for all the sections you can you the copy polygons function in the
edit options pulldown to copy the test section to all the sections at once.
When you apply a test section, if the <A HREF="#Wave_Mode">active wave mode</A>
is <EM>one</EM>, the section will be applied to the current section in the
toggled wave. If the wave mode is <EM>all</EM>, the test section will be
applied to that current section in all the waves.

<P>When <EM>Copy Polygons</EM> is selected from the
<A HREF="#Edit_Options">edit pulldown</A> in the EditPolygon dialog, a dialog
is displayed in which the sections to be used as the source and destination
are entered.  Pressing the <EM>Do it</EM> button in this dialog performs
the copy.  The source region is controlled by the controls on the lefthand
side of the dialog and the destination by the controls on the right.  The
toggles on the left control how the copy is performed.

<P>If the uppermost toggle on the left (the one next to the <EM>z</EM>
field) is on, the copy is done from a single section specified by the values
in the <EM>z</EM>, <EM>time</EM>, and <EM>wave</EM> fields on the lefthand
side.  The polygons in this section are copied to the range of sections
specified by the <EM>z</EM> field, <EM>time</EM> field, and <EM>wave</EM>
toggles on the right.  The z and time destination ranges are controlled by
two values:  the first is the starting point and the second is the final
point.  If the destination range includes the source section, the polygons
in that section will not appear twice.

<P>If the second toggle on the left (the one next to the <EM>time</EM>
field) is on, the copy is done from all z sections in a single time point
and wave as specified by the <EM>time</EM> and <EM>wave</EM> fields on the
left.  The destination for the copy is all z sections for the range of times
and waves specified on the right.  If the destination range includes the
source time and wave, the polygons in that time and wave will not appear twice.

<P>If the third toggle on the left (the one next to the <EM>wave</EM>
field) is on, the copy is done from all time points z sections in
the wave given by the <EM>wave</EM> field on the left.  The destination
is all the corresponding time and z points in the waves selected
on the right.  If the destination waves includes the source wave, the
polygons in that wave will not appear twice.

<P>If the fourth toggle on the left is on, the copy is done from the
<A HREF="#Test_Section">test section</A> to all sections in the range
set by the <EM>z</EM> field, <EM>time</EM> field, and <EM>wave</EM> toggles
on the right.

<P>In all cases the <EM>set all</EM> button may be used to have the destination
cover the entire data set.

<H2><A NAME="Auto_Polygon">AutoPolygon</A></H2>
<P>When EditPolygon is in the autopolygon mode, rather than manually selecting
all the vertices of a polygon, a seed point is selected and that is used
to generate the polygon (or polygons if a 3D search is enabled).  While in
the EditPolygon mode a dialog is displayed that controls the algorithm used
to generate a polygon from the seed point (if the dialog is not visible, it
can be redisplayed by resetting the <A HREF="#Action_Mode">action mode</A>
option menu to <EM>Auto</EM>.  Use the <EM>auto pick file</EM> button in the
dialog to select a list of seed points in
<A HREF="Pick.html">Pick Points format</A> in lieu of selecting the seed
points manually.  Use the <EM>more tools...</EM> button to display a dialog
with controls to propagate the polygons from one section to other sections.

<P>Use the <EM>method</EM> option menu in the autopolygon dialog to select
the type of algorithm used to generate a polygon from a seed point.  Adjacent
to it is an option menu to control whether a polygon is only generated on
the current section (the <EM>2D</EM> option) or if the seed point is used
to generate polygons on sections within <VAR>x</VAR> sections of the current
section where <VAR>x</VAR> is the value shown in the <EM>max z reach</EM>
field.  The <EM>biggest change</EM>, <EM>percent change</EM>,
<EM>rate of change</EM>, and <EM>change from center</EM> algorithms are
radial search algorithms:  a search is done along each of
<VAR>num points</VAR> evenly spaced rays from the seed point to determine
where to place the boundary.  The radial search is done for points between
<VAR>min xy reach</VAR> and <VAR>max xy reach</VAR> pixels from the seed
point; if the search fails the boundary is placed at <VAR>max xy reach</VAR>
pixels from the seed point.  The search criteria for these methods are:

<DL>
  <DT><STRONG>biggest change</STRONG><DD>Searches for the largest absolute
    intensity change along the ray subject to the requirement that it occur
    at a distance from the seed point which is no more than
    <VAR>max length diff</VAR> pixels different from the distance between the
    boundary point on the previous ray and the seed point.
  <DT><STRONG>percent change</STRONG><DD>Searches for the first point
    along the ray at which the relative intensity along the ray exceeds
    a threshold and whose distance from the seed point is no more
    than <VAR>max length diff</VAR> pixels different from the distance
    between the boundary point on the previous ray and the seed point
    The threshold for the relative intensity change is expressed as a
    percentage and is shown in the <EM>change</EM> field.  Whether the
    threshold is crossed for an increase, decrease, or either increase or
    decrease in intensity is controlled by the <EM>change</EM> option menu.
    The available options are:
    <DL>
      <DT>% higher<DD>The threshold is crossed only for a relative increase
        which is larger than the threshold value.
      <DT>% lower<DD>The threshold is crossed only for a relative decrease
        which is larger than the threshold value.
      <DT>% hi/lo<DD>The threshold is crossed for relative increases or
        decreases which are larger than the threshold level.
    </DL>
  <DT><STRONG>rate of change</STRONG><DD>Searches for the largest rate of
    change in intensity along the ray subject to the requirement that it occur
    at a distance from the seed point which is no more than
    <VAR>max length diff</VAR> pixels different from the distance between the
    boundary point on the previous ray and the seed point.
  <DT><STRONG>change from center</STRONG><DD>Is similar to the
    <EM>percent change</EM> method, but instead of comparing adjacent
    samples along the ray to determine the relative intensity change, the
    comparison is done between the sample and the intensity at the seed point.
</DL>

<P>The other method, <EM>tracer % change</EM>, is the one that is recommended
for most applications.  It uses the same criteria as
<EM>change from center</EM> to locate a point on the polygon edge to the right
of the seed point.  A second point on the boundary is then located by
searching downward from the first edge point.  Subsequent points on the
boundary are located by searching in the direction established by the previous
two points for a sample whose change in intensity relative to the seed point
matches the same criteria as used for <EM>change from center</EM>.  Because of
the nature of the search, it is not necessary for the seed point to lie within
the polygon which is generated.  For this method, <EM>num points</EM> sets the
minimum number of points that a generated polygon will have (if the polygon
were to have fewer, it will not be generated at all).  <EM>step size</EM> sets
the distance between adjacent vertices on the traced boundary.

<P>For all methods, intensity measurements are based on a local average
of the intensity values.  The size, in pixels, of the square region used
to perform the average is given in the <EM>sample size</EM> field.

<P>The polygon that is generated can be larger or smaller than the boundary
found using any of the methods.  If the <EM>extend</EM> field is nonzero,
the vertices of the polygon are shifted by that number of pixels from the
vertices of the boundary (the shift is radial relative to the seed point).
     
<P>For each algorithm, the choice of relative intensity threshold,
<VAR>num points</VAR>, <VAR>step size</VAR>, <VAR>sample size</VAR>,
<VAR>min xy reach</VAR>, <VAR>max xy reach</VAR>, <VAR>max z reach</VAR>,
<VAR>max length diff</VAR>, and <VAR>extend</VAR> are recorded in the
.iveprefs subdirectory of your home directory.  The last values for these
parameters will be restored whenever the choice of algorithm is changed.

<P>Automatically generated polygons can have sharp edges.  You can selectively
smooth these (see the <A HREF="#Action_Mode">action mode</A> and
<A HREF="#Hot_Keys">hot keys</A> topics for details) or, if the
<EM>automatic smooth</EM> toggle is on, the polygons are smoothed immediately
after they are generated.

<P>The propagation of polygons from one section to another (via the
controls in the dialog opened by the <EM>more tools...</EM> button), is
done by determining a seed point for each of the existing polygons and then
applying the algorithms described above to generate new polygons from those
seed points.  To use the propagation tools, you must determine the
section whose polygons are to be used as the source and enter the corresponding
z, wave, and time indices in the <EM>Using ZWT</EM> field.  The determination
of the seed point from the existing polygon is controlled by the
<EM>using last picked pt</EM> toggle.  If this toggle is off or if the
existing polygon was not generated with the autopolygon tools, the seed
point is the geometric center of the existing polygon.  If this toggle is on,
the seed point is the seed point that was used to generate the existing
polygon.  With those values selected, press the
<EM>AutoPick Current Section</EM> button to propagate the polygons to the
currently displayed section or press the <EM>AutoPick Range</EM> button
to propagate the polygons to the range of sections given by the
<EM>z range</EM> and <EM>t range</EM> fields.  The <EM>set all</EM> button
is a shortcut for changing the z and time ranges to cover the entire dataset.

<P>There are several toggles in the EditPolygon dialog which control
how polygon graphics are displayed in the image window.  The effects
of these toggles are:

<DL>
  <DT><STRONG>show graphics zwt</STRONG><DD>If this toggle is on, the
    adjacent field specifies the z, wave, and time indices for a reference
    section; the polygons in the reference section will be displayed in
    light brown regardless of the section currently visible in the image
    window.
  <DT><STRONG>show polygons in all waves</STRONG><DD>When on, all polygons
    in the currently displayed z section and time point are displayed,
    regardless of the wave.
  <DT><STRONG>graphics</STRONG><DD>When on, the outlines of the polygons
    are displayed in the image window; when off, they are not displayed.
