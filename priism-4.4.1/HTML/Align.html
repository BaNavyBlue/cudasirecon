<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>When working with multiple wavelength data, a variety of factors can
cause the images from different wavelengths to be misaligned.  <EM>Align</EM>
allows you to correct for shifts between the wavelengths when displaying
the data; it does this by presenting an interface by which you can
interactively select the amount (the <A HREF="#OffsetVector">offset vector</A>)
the images from each wave are shifted relative to the center of the image
window.  To change the offset, you can either edit the values listed for
each wave or use the arrow buttons.  The arrow buttons adjust the offset
for <A HREF="#WaveSelection">all wavelengths which have been toggled on</A> 
in the <EM>Align</EM> dialog.  The amount of the adjustment is shown in the
field in the center of the arrows and can be changed by changing the value
in that field.  The <EM>Reset</EM> button zeroes the offset vectors for any
selected waves (causing the images for those waves to be centered in the image
window).

<P>The <A HREF="Monitor.html#LeftToolBar">Centr, Grab, and Home buttons</A>
on the image window will undo any relative offsets between the waves that you
set with <EM>Align</EM>.

<P>The offset vector for each wavelength has two components:  the horizontal
(shown first) and vertical (shown second) shifts from the center of the image
window.  Both are expressed in terms of data pixels (the zoom factor for the
image window controls how a data pixel maps to a pixel in the image window)
and must be integers.  The sign convention for the offsets is such that a
negative horizontal offset moves the image to the right and a negative
vertical offset moves the image upward.

<P>For each wavelength in the data set, there is a toggle to control whether
or not the arrow buttons or <EM>Reset</EM> button affect the offset applied
to images from that wavelength.  Next to the toggle button for each wavelength
is a field with the <A HREF="#OffsetVector">values of the offset vector</A>
for that wavelength.
