  You should only encounter this if you run a version of Priism prior
  to Priism 4.2.7 or have a custom set of preferences.  In either case,
  you can resolve the problem with the following steps:

  1) Select "File-&gt;Preferences" from the Priism menu.
  2) In the "IVE Preferences" dialog that appears, check
     what profile is currently selected:  if it is not "Default"
     then do the following:

       a) Select "Preferences-&gt;Startup" from the menu at the
          top of the "IVE Preferences" dialog.
       b) Turn off the "Stereo in window" option.  It is on
          the third line from the bottom of the dialog.
       c) Press the button labeled "Close" at the bottom of the
          dialog.
       d) Select "File-&gt;Save" from the menu at the top of the
          "IVE Preferences" dialog to save your changes.
       e) Restart Priism for your changes to take effect.

     If the profile labeled "Default" is currently selected,
     select "File-&gt;New..." from the menu at the top of the
     "IVE Preferences" dialog.  In the dialog that appears,
     enter the name of the new profile of preferences ("NoStereo"
     is a decent choice for a name) and then press the "Accept"
     button.  Then proceed with steps a through e given above.
