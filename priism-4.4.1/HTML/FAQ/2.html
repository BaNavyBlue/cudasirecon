Subject:    -2- How do I change where the shared memory file is stored?

  Set the environment variable IVE_SHMDIR to the name of the directory
  where you want to store the file and restart Priism.  You'll need
  write access to the directory; it's also preferable that you have
  fast access to the directory and plenty of space (the shared memory
  file and temporary files can be hundreds of megabytes for typical
  sessions).
