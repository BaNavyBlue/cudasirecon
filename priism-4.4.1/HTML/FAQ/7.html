  You can run ivekill at the command line to force Priism and the 
  associated windows to exit.  If the Priism menu bar has disappeared
  but other Priism windows are still open, running ivekill with the -f
  option:

    ivekill -f

  may be more effective.  The handling of clean up in Priism could
  definitely use some work.
