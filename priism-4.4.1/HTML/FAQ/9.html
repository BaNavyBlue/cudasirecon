Subject:    -9- Priism starts but does not open windows; what can I do?
Date:  6 Jun 2003 18:00:00 PDT

  The most common cause for this is a previous Priism session that
  did not exit cleanly.  Priism 4.1.6 and later versions have a
  mechanism that usually detects the remains of the previous session
  and allows correct start up; earlier versions do not and always
  assume they are reconnecting to a running session. The solution to
  the problem is:

    1) Exit Priism.
    2) Run ivekill from the command line.  See question 7 in the
       FAQ for more information about ivekill.
