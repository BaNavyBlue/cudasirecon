Subject:    -6- Priism won't start; what can I do?

  There are a number of things to check depending on whether or not
  the system has told you anything about why it failed.  The paragraphs
  that follow cover the more easily handled situations.


  If you see a message like "Priism: Command not found" or
  "IWStart: error starting monitor 0: No such file or directory",
  the environment (specifically the PATH environment variable) is
  not correctly set so Priism executables can be found.  A message like

    rld: Fatal Error: Cannot Successfully map soname libIWL.so ...

  on IRIX or

    Priism: error in loading shared libraries: libIWL.so ...

  on Linux is also a likely indicator that your environment (the 
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable on IRIX and LINUX; the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
  environment variable on MacOS X) is not set correctly.


  You should first verify that you did set the environment for
  running Priism.  If your shell is bash or sh (i.e. running the
  command

      basename `echo "$SHELL"`

  prints bash or sh), you should run

      . path_to_priism_directory/Priism_setup.sh

  prior to starting Priism.  If your shell is tcsh or csh, then you
  should use

      source path_to_priism_directory/Priism_setup

  as the command to set the Priism environment.  You'll need to
  replace path_to_priism_directory with the path to where Priism
  installed.  For instance, if the directory /Applications/Priism
  holds the Priism files and you use bash as your shell, you would
  need to run

      . /Applications/Priism_setup.sh

  before running Priism.  Please note that the space between the
  period and the slash is significant.  Without that space the
  command will run but will not have the desired side effects.
  After running the setup command appropriate for your shell, you
  should see a message like "Priism 4.2.5 set up; type Priism to
  run it" (instead of 4.2.5 you should see a version number matching
  the version of Priism installed).  If you see any other messages,
  that usually indicates that you did not use the correct path to
  where Priism is installed or did not use the setup command
  appropriate for your shell.


  If you have executed the command to set the environment but Priism
  still does not run and you see an error messages like those
  mentioned above, you should talk to the person who installed Priism
  and ask him or her what you should do.  If you are the person who
  installed Priism, you may not have run post_install.sh or you may
  have moved Priism since running post_install.sh.  Changing directories
  to where Priism is installed and running post_install.sh will take
  care of either of those situations.  You'll then need to rerun the
  command to set the environment for Priism.  For more details about
  the post-installation script, consule the installation instructions at

  (for IVE 4) or

    &lt;<a href="http://msg.ucsf.edu/IVE/Download/PriismInstallation.html">http://msg.ucsf.edu/IVE/Download/PriismInstallation.html</a>&gt;
 
  (for IVE 3.3).


  Another thing that can prevent Priism from starting is if a previous
  Priism session failed to delete its shared memory file.  Priism 4.1.6
  and later are better at dectecting the dead session and avoiding the
  problem.  For all versions, you can run ivekill from the command line
  to delete the shared memory file.
