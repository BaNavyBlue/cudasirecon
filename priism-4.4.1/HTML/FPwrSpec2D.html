<H1><A NAME="FPwrSpec2D">2D Power Spectrum</A></H1>
<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>The program estimates the 2D power spectra for each input section by
performing one or more forward transforms, finding their squared magnitudes,
and averaging the results.  This can then be smoothed if desired.  The smoothed
average is the expected power at each frequency; the result written is the
square root of that.

<P>The controls in the user interface include a
<A HREF="Region.html">standard set of controls</A> for selecting the input
file, output file, and region of interest and for starting and interrupting
processing.  The other controls are organized as follows:

<UL>
  <LI>Use the <A HREF="#Preprocessing">button labeled "Set preprocessing"</A>
    to display and change the parameters which control the processing of the
    data before it is split into blocks and transformed.  By default, no
    preprocessing is done.
  <LI>Use the <A HREF="#Averaging/Smoothing">button labeled
    "Set averaging/smoothing"</A> to open a dialog with the settings for
    how many blocks a 2D input region is broken into and how much smoothing
    is applied to the average result.
  <LI>Use the <A HREF="#Window">button labeled "Set window/taper"</A> to select
    a function used to smooth out discontinuities at the edges of the data
    after it has been preprocessed and split into blocks.  By default, no
    smoothing is done.
  <LI>Use the <A HREF="#OutputFormat">button labeled "Set output format"</A>
    to open a dialog with controls for the form of the output:  whether or
    not the log of the square root of the power is taken, and whether or not
    the result is shifted to center the zero frequency component.
</UL>

<P>There are a couple things to note about this application:

<UL>
  <LI>The pixel format for the output is always floating-point reals.
  <LI>For the x and y dimensions, the pixel spacings are nxs / (nx * dx)
    and nys / (ny * dy) where nx and ny are the dimensions, in pixels,
    of the block transformed, dx and dy are the input pixel spacings, and
    nxs and nys are the dimensions of the smoothing box in pixels.
  <LI>The x and y start indices in the header are set to zero.  The x and y
    coordinates for the origin are set to zero if the zero frequency is not
    centered; otherwise, they are set to the most negative frequencies
    present, in units of the output pixel spacing.  The z start index
    and z coordinate for the origin are not modified.
</UL>

<P>The input region can be processed to remove an offset or trend before
the data is broken into blocks, tapered, and transformed.  To display
the controls for this processing, press the button labeled
<EM>Set preprocessing</EM> in the main dialog.  There are five types of
processing that can be done; select one by pressing the appropriate toggle
in the dialog.  The processing options are:

<DL>
  <DT>None<DD>The input is not modified before the data is split into
    blocks, tapered, and transformed.
  <DT>Subtract offset<DD>The specified value is subtracted from all the input
    values.
  <DT>Subtract mean<DD>For each 2D (xy) input region, the mean of the region
    is subtracted from all values in the region.
  <DT>Remove linear trend<DD>An average slope for each 2D (xy) input region
    is estimated by averaging values from the first and last third of each
    dimension; the linear trend corresponding to that average slope and
    the mean of the region is subtracted from the input data.  The algorithm
    used is the average slope method extended to two dimensions (Digital data
    analysis procedures, Bendat and Piersol, 1st Edition, 1971, page 288).
  <DT>Remove trends up to order<DD>A polynomial of the given order is fit to
    each 2D (xy) input region.  That polynomial evaluated at each input point
    is then subtracted from the input before the data is split into blocks,
    tapered, and transformed.
</DL>

<P>If you are intending to taper the data and the data does not already have
a zero mean, you should consider using the mean subtraction, linear trend
removal, or polynomial fit options.

<H2><A NAME="Averaging/Smoothing">Averaging/Smoothing</A></H2>
<P>This application provides two ways to reduce the variance of the
spectra estimate:  breaking the input region into blocks which are
handled separately and then averaged and smoothing of the spectra.

<P>Breaking the input into blocks is controlled by the parameters of the
top half of the dialog opened with the <EM>Set averaging/smoothing</EM>
button.  The inputs are the x and y size in pixels for each block,
the percent of the block that overlaps with the block to the left and to
the bottom, and the number of blocks in x and y.  When the
<EM>Automatically adjust for best coverage</EM> toggle is on, changing
the overlap or size will cause the count to be adjusted so there is as
many blocks as possible, and when the number of blocks is adjusted, the
size will be changed so that it is an efficiently handled size and as
much of the input region is covered as possible.  When the toggle is off,
the size, overlap, and count can be varied independently within the constraint
that the blocks must all fit in the input region.  When breaking the
input into blocks, a common approach is to fully <A HREF="#Window">taper</A>
each block and have a 50% overlap.

<P>The amount of smoothing done is set in the <EM>Size</EM> field at the
bottom of the dialog.  Each output pixel is the summation of the unsmoothed
result over a rectangle of the size shown.  The size in each direction must be
a positive odd integer.  To ensure that a purely real input results in
a spectra with the correct symmetry about the origin, choose the smoothing
size for a dimension such that

<PRE>
  (floor(n / 2) - floor(s / 2) + s - 1) / s
</PRE>

<P>is even where n is the block size in that dimension.

<P>Applying a windowing function, also called tapering, multiplies the
data by a function which goes to zero (or near zero) at the edges of the
data.  This is done after preprocessing and splitting the data into blocks
to remove discontinuities at the edges which can complicate the
interpretation of frequency spectra; the disadvantage of applying a window
is that it essentially throws away parts of the input and it broadens
features in the spectra.  The former problem can be alleviated by overlapping
the blocks that are transformed.

<P>The windowing functions used are separable, i.e, the windowing function,
W(x,y), can be written as the product of WX(x) and WY(y).  WX and WY are
calculated from the same formula but with different inputs for the number
of pixels, n, and the fraction, f, of the dimension that is attenuated
by the windowing function.  The two values in the <EM>Coverage</EM>
field are the values of f divided by two for the x and y directions
respectively.  Commonly used values for the coverage are 0.5 (a "full taper")
and 0.1 (a 10% taper).  The power, x, is used by half-sine windowing function.

<P>The functions used to calculate the windowing functions are shown below.
i is the pixel index and runs from 0 to n minus 1, and e is given by

<PRE>
      { floor(0.5 + f / 2.0 * n)          n even

<P>The output spectra is scaled so that summing over the spectra gives an
estimate of the variance of the input data.  By default the frequencies are
ordered so that zero frequency is at (0, 0) and positive Nyquist frequency
in both directions is located at (nx/2, ny/2) where nx and ny are the sizes
of a block.  Use the button labeled <EM>Set output format</EM> in the main
dialog to open a dialog with controls that allow modifications to the default
format.  The available options are:

<DL>
  <DT>Center zero frequency<DD>The output is shifted so zero frequency is at
    ((nx-1)/2, (ny-1)/2).
  <DT>Take log10 of result<DD>The logarithm base 10 of the normally scaled
    result is reported.

<P>FPwrSpec2D accepts the command-line arguments described in
<A HREF="Region.html#COMMANDLINE">Region.html</A>.  In addition, FPwrSpec2D
accepts the options shown below (optional parts are shown in brackets).  If
mutually exclusive options (i.e. for selection of the windowing function),
the last option that appears on the command line takes precedence.  The
default is to calculate the square root of the power spectrum without any
preprocessing, no tapering of the data, and no averaging or smoothing.
