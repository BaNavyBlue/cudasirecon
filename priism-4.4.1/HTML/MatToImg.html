<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>MatToImg takes a MATLAB workspace file and converts it to Priism's native
format for image stacks.  MATLAB workspace files typically have a <EM>.mat</EM>
extension and are created with MATLAB's <EM>save</EM> command.  The conversion
takes only two parameters:  <EM>MAT file</EM> is the name of the MATLAB
workspace file to read and <EM>IVE file</EM> is the name of the Priism file
to generate.

<P>If MatToImg is invoked with something other than two arguments, it
will display a graphical user interface for entering the MAT file name
and IVE file name.  If it is invoked with two arguments, no user interface
will be displayed: the first argument is used as name of the MAT file to read
and the second is used as the name of the IVE file to generate.

<P>MatToImg uses the MATLAB shared libraries and those will have to present
on your computer for MatToImg to be able to convert files.  The easiest way to
configure MatToImg so that it finds the shared libraries is to rerun the
<A HREF="PriismInstallation.html#Step2">post-installation script for Priism</A>;
that script will ask you the location of the directory that contains MATLAB.

<P>The output file is a three-dimensional data stack where each
two-dimensional z section represents a two-dimensional matrix stored
in the workspace file or a slice (where the first two dimensions vary)
through a three- or higher dimensional matrix.  The sections in the output
are filled by taking (and slicing as necessary) the matrices in the order
in which they appear in the workspace file.  The slices from higher
dimensional matrices appear in adjacent z-sections.  The matrices must
all have the same first two dimensions and must all be real-valued represented
as double-precision floating-point or must all be complex-valued represented
as double-precision floating-point.  If these conditions are not met, MatToImg
will issue a warning about not being able to read the workspace file.

<P>The inverse of MatToImg, <A HREF="ImgToMat.html">ImgToMat</A>, generates
workspace files which can be used as input to MatToImg.
