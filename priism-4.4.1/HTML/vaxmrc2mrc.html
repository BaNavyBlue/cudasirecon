<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>In IVE 3 and IVE 3.3 prior to June 1999, image data written by IVE on
a VAX system was automatically detected and converted without user
intervention.  From June 1999 on, IVE 3.3 no longer has this capability
and when VAX data is read the floating-point values in the header,
extended header, and data will be garbled.  The command-line utility
vaxmrc2mrc can be used to convert the data file to a form compatible
with IVE 3.3.  vaxmrc2mrc takes two arguments.  The first is the name
of the input file, and the second is the name of the output file.  The
conversion is not done in place and the input file name and output file
name should not reference the same file.  As an example,

<PRE>
     vaxmrc2mrc oldvaximage.dat image.dat
</PRE>

<P>reads the file <EM>oldvaximage.dat</EM> from the current directory and
writes out the converted result in <EM>image.dat</EM> in the current
directory.
