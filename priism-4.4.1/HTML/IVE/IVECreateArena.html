<H1>Reference: IVECreateArena</H1>
<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>Creates a <A HREF="IVEArena.html">shared memory segment</A>.
<H2>Prototype (C)</H2>
<P><CODE>#include "ive_shm.h"</CODE>
<BR><CODE>IVEArena IVECreateArena(const char* filename, IVEArenaAttr attr, int fail_if_exist, int* p_status);</CODE>
<H2>Prototype (Fortran)</H2>
<P>There is no Fortran interface.
<H2>Parameters</H2>
<DL>
  <DT><VAR>filename</VAR><DD><VAR>filename</VAR> is the name to use for the
    shared memory segment.  As currently implemented, this name must be that
    of a regular disk file (not a device file).
  <DT><VAR>attr</VAR><DD><VAR>attr</VAR> specifies the attributes of the
    arena.  If <VAR>attr</VAR> is zero (NULL), the default attributes are
    used.
  <DT><VAR>fail_if_exist</VAR><DD>Only has an effect if <VAR>filename</VAR>
    exists.  If <VAR>fail_if_exist</VAR> is true, then
    the function call will fail if <VAR>filename</VAR> exists.  If
    <VAR>fail_if_exist</VAR> is false and <VAR>filename</VAR> exists, the
    function will act as <A HREF="IVEAttachArena.html">IVEAttachArena</A>
    does if <VAR>filename</VAR> appears to be a valid shared memory file
    or will overwrite <VAR>filename</VAR> if it does not appear to be a
    valid shared memory file.
  <DT><VAR>p_status</VAR><DD>If the call to IVECreateArena returns zero,
    then *<VAR>p_status</VAR> will be set to one of the values listed
    below if <VAR>p_status</VAR> is not zero.    
    <DL>
      <DT>IVE_ERR_NO_MEM<DD>There was insufficient memory available to
        complete the operation.
      <DT>IVE_ERR_NO_SPC<DD>There was insufficient disk space to create
        a lock file.
      <DT>IVE_ERR_NO_RESOURCES<DD>There was insufficient system resources
        available (other than memory) to complete the operation.
      <DT>IVE_ERR_IN_USE<DD>Another thread was in the process of creating
        or attaching to <VAR>filename</VAR>.
      <DT>IVE_ERR_TIMEOUT<DD>The operation could not be completed because
        it was interrupted too many times by signals or access to a remote
        filesystem timed out.
      <DT>IVE_ERR_IO<DD>The operation could not be completed because an
        I/O error occurred.
      <DT>IVE_ERR_NO_PERMISSION<DD>The caller does not have sufficient
        privileges to access <VAR>filename</VAR> or it is in a read-only
        filesystem.
      <DT>IVE_ERR_EXIST<DD><VAR>fail_if_exist</VAR> is true, and a file
        whose file name is <VAR>filename</VAR> is present.
      <DT>IVE_ERR_UNSUPPORTED<DD>The file size is not supported by the
        file system or the other operations to create the shared memory segment
        are not supported by the operating system.
      <DT>IVE_ERR_INVALID<DD>The size of the arena specified by <VAR>attr</VAR>
        is too small to hold the arena header.
      <DT>IVE_ERR_BAD_FILENAME<DD><VAR>filename</VAR> does not exist or
        is a directory.
      <DT>IVE_ERR_INTERNAL<DD>An error internal to the library was detected.
        This is most likely because of a bug in the library.
      <DT>IVE_ERR_UNRECOGNIZED<DD>The operating system or system library
        returned an error code that was not expected.
    </DL>
</DL>
<H2>Return value</H2>
<P>If the function call fails, zero is returned.  Otherwise, a non-zero
value is returned.  When the application is done with the arena, it can
destroy it with <A HREF="IVEDestroyArena.html">IVEDestroyArena</A> or just
detach from it with <A HREF="IVEDetachArena.html">IVEDetachArena</A>.
