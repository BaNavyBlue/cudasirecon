<H1>Reference: IVEGetExecutableName</H1>
<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>IVEGetExecutableName determines the path of the caller's executable.  The
returned path may be a symbolic link to the executable and not the executable
file itself.  IVEGetExecutableName may not operate reliably under the following
conditions:
<UL>
    <LI>IVEGetExecutableName is called from a multithreaded process and the
      process's initial thread has exited.
    <LI>On operating systems where there is not a direct call to get the
      executable path, IVEGetExecutableName has to infer the path from the
      argument, <VAR>argv0</VAR>, assumed to be the value of argv[0] passed
      to the application when it started.  If argv[0] was not set to the
      executable name when the process was launched, inferring the appropriate
      path name will not be possible.  If argv[0] was set to the executable
      name but it is not a full path, the path inferred will depend on the
      values for the current working directory and search path which may not
      match what they were for the environment when the process was launched.
</UL>
<H2>Prototype (C)</H2>
<P><CODE>#include "ive_file.h"</CODE>
<BR><CODE>size_t IVEGetExecutableName(const char* argv0, size_t length, char* name);</CODE>
<H2>Prototype (Fortran)</H2>
<P><CODE>integer IVEGetExecutableName(argv0, name)</CODE>
<BR><CODE>character*(*) argv0, name</CODE>
<H2>Parameters</H2>
<DL>
  <DT><VAR>argv0</VAR><DD>(in) If the operating system does not provide a
    direct way to determine the executable name, the value of this argument
    will be used to try and infer the executable name.  If calling from C, you
    would normally pass the value of argv[0] passed to main() for
    <VAR>argv0</VAR>.  If calling from Fortran, you would normally get the
    value of <VAR>argv0</VAR> with <CODE>call getarg(0, argv0)</CODE>.  You
    can pass an empty string or, if calling from C, a null pointer, for
    <VAR>argv0</VAR>.  In that case, IVEGetExecutableName will only use the
    operating system's direct method to determine the executable name.  If the
    operating system does not have a direct method and <VAR>name</VAR> can hold
    at least one character, IVEGetExecutableName will return zero and set name
    to an empty string.
  <DT><VAR>length</VAR><DD>(in) Is the maximum number of characters (including
    the terminating null character in C) that can be stored in <VAR>name</VAR>.
  <DT><VAR>name</VAR><DD>(out) Upon completion, IVEGetExecutableName will fill
    <VAR>name</VAR> with the path to the caller's executable if that path will
    fit in <VAR>name</VAR>.  Otherwise, the contents of <VAR>name</VAR> are not
    specified when IVEGetExecutableName returns.
</DL>
<H2>Return value</H2>
<P>IVEGetExecutableName will return zero and fill <VAR>name</VAR> with the
path to the caller's executable if <VAR>name</VAR> has sufficient space to
hold the path.  Otherwise, IVEGetExecutableName will return the amount of
space needed to hold the path.
