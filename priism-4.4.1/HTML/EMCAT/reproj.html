<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>reproj is a command-line application that takes a 3D reconstruction and
a model tilt series and generates another tilt series which is a reprojection
of the 3D reconstruction and has the same tilt angles as the model tilt series.
The x and y dimensions of the generated tilt series are the same as the x and z
dimensions of the reconstruction.  The command-line syntax for reproj is
(optional parts are in brackets)

<PRE>
    <CODE>reproj</CODE> <VAR>recon_name</VAR> <VAR>model_series_name</VAR> <VAR>series_name</VAR> [-slab] [-res=i] [-multires]
</PRE>

<P>The three arguments are

<DL>
  <DT><VAR>recon_name</VAR><DD>Is the name of the MRC file containing the 3D
    reconstruction.  The reconstruction is assumed to be in the unflipped
    (xzy) orientation generated by Priism's
    <A HREF="EWBP.html">weighted backprojection</A> or
    <A HREF="TAPIR.html">tapir</A> modules.
  <DT><VAR>model_series_name</VAR><DD>Is the name of the MRC file containing
    the model tilt series.  reproj only uses the header of this file.
  <DT><VAR>series_name</VAR><DD>Is the name of the MRC file that reproj will
    generate.  reproj will not work correctly if <VAR>series_name</VAR> refers
    to the same file as <VAR>model_series_name</VAR>.
</DL>

<P>The three options are

<DL>
  <DT><CODE>-slab</CODE><DD>Causes reproj to scale the projection results
    under the assumption that the reconstruction is a portion of a large
    slab with roughly uniform intensity and the same height as the
    reconstruction.
  <DT><CODE>-res=</CODE><VAR>i</VAR><DD>Causes reproj to read from the
    <VAR>i</VAR>th resolution of the reconstruction.  <VAR>i</VAR> must
    be a non-negative integer less than the number of resolutions in the
    reconstruction.  If you do not specify the -res option, reproj will use
    the highest resolution (i.e. act as if you gave it the option -res=0).
  <DT><CODE>-multires</CODE><DD>Causes reproj to add lower resolutions to the
    generated tilt series if the x and y dimensions are sufficiently large.
    If you do not specify this option, reproj will generate a tilt series
    with a single resolution.
</DL>
