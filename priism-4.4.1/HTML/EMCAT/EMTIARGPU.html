<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>EMTIARGPU is a front-end for the iterative alignment and reconstruction of
EM tomography data.  It is essentially the same as
<A HREF="EMTIAR.html">EMTIAR</A> but uses servers outfitted with graphics
cards to accelerate the reconstruction and projection calculations.

<P>The basic recipe for generating a reconstruction with EMTIARGPU is:

<OL>
  <LI>Use the mass-normalization and alignment components of
    <A HREF="EMTAR.html">EMTAR</A> to generate the final values for the
    mass-normalization parameters and initial guess for the alignment
    parameters.  If your data has fiducial markers, you can use
    <A HREF="BALIGN.html">BALIGN</A> instead to generate the initial guess
    for the alignment parameters and then use the mass-normalization component
    of EMTAR to add the mass-normalization values.
  <LI>Start EMTIARGPU.  Enter the name of the tilt series in the "TiltSeries"
    field at the top of the dialog.  Enter the name of the file with the
    mass-normalization parameters and initial guess at the alignment
    parameters in the "InAlignParam" field at the top of the dialog.
  <LI>Adjust other parameters.  Parameters that are commonly changed are:
    <DL>
      <DT>The resolution level to process<DD>If you've added multiple
        resolutions to the input tilt series using
        <A HREF="../AppendRes.html">AppendRes</A> with a z scaling of one, then
        you can enter the resolution level (zero is the highest) to process in
        the <A HREF="#Resolution">"Resolution" field</A>.  The generated
        alignment parameters will always be in terms of the coordinates of the
        highest resolution.  The generated reconstruction will be at the
        selected resolution level.  Size-related input parameters are
        automatically scaled by the resolution factor so you should choose
        values for those that are appropriate for the highest
        resolution.  Performing initial refinement at lower resolutions can
        significantly speed up the process because the reconstructions are
        smaller.
      <DT>Bounds of the reconstructed volume<DD>The bounds are controlled by
        the <A HREF="#ReconstructionShift">"Reconstruction shift"</A> and
        <A HREF="#ReconstructionZSize">"Reconstruction Z size"</A> fields.  The
        x and y dimensions of the reconstruction are constrained to be the
        same size as the x and y dimensions of the input tilt series.
        <A HREF="EMTAR.html">EMTAR</A> has methods to interactively select
        the bounds; you can use them and then copy the values from EMTAR's
        "Shift (XYZ)" field to the "Reconstruction shift" field in EMTIARGPU
        and the third value in EMTAR's "Size XYZ" field to the
        "Reconstruction Z size" field in EMTIARGPU.
      <DT><A HREF="#NumberOfRuns">Number of runs</A><DD>This is the number of
        times the steps of reconstruction, reprojection, and alignment to the
        reprojection are repeated.
      <DT><A HREF="Parallel.html#GPUParallel">GPU execution settings</A><DD>To
        change which hosts are used for GPU calculations and how to start
        the software on those hosts, turn off the toggle button, labeled
        "default", next to the button labeled "GPU execution settings..." and
        then press the button labeled "GPU execution settings...".  That will
        open another dialog with the relevant controls.  Those controls are
        described in the <A HREF="Parallel.html#GPUParallel">"GPU Parallel
        Settings" section of Parallel.html</A>.  When the toggle button next
        to the "GPU execution settings..." button is on, the Refine Alignment
        uses what has been configured for the queue or host currently selected
        from the button labeled "Options" in the main dialog.
    </DL>
  <LI>Press the "Do It" button to start the alignment and reconstruction.
    Before pressing "Do It" you way want to alter the job submission settings
    by pressing the "Options" button at the bottom of the EMTIARGPU dialog.
    The job submission settings are described in the
    <A HREF="../BatchRegion.html">batch processing interface documentation</A>.
</OL>

<P>Besides a log file, the iterative alignment and reconstruction generates
two outputs.  The first is an alignment parameter file for each iteration.
The names for these files are the contents of the "OutParamBase" field
with an underscore, the iteration number, and the extension of the input
alignment parameter file appended.  The second output is the data for the
reconstructed volume.  The file name for the reconstructed volume is in the
"Reconstruction" field.

<H2><A NAME="Resolution">Resolution</A></H2>
<P>The resolution parameter selects which resolution to process from the
input tilt series.  0 is the highest (full) resolution.  Normally all
that you need to do to process a different resolution is set the resolution
parameter.  There are other parameters in the special parameters dialog
that affect the handling of different resolutions
(<A HREF="#GuessResolution">guess resolution</A>,
<A HREF="#ResolutionScale">resolution scale</A>, and
<A HREF="#FullSize">full size</A>), but in typical cases the user interface
chooses correct defaults for those parameters.

<P><A HREF="#EMTIARGPU">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="ApplyMassnorm">Apply Massnorm</A></H2>
<P>The default behavior for the iterative alignment and reconstruction has
an initialization step where the mass-normalization parameters are used to
generate a mass-normalized (but not aligned) version of the input tilt series.
The toggle button next to "Apply massnorm" controls whether or not to use
the initialization step.  If you have already applied the mass-normalization
parameters to the input tilt series, turn the toggle button off; otherwise,
make sure it is on.

<P>Two controls affect the application of the mass-normalization parameters
during the initialization step.  The menu at the end of the
"Apply massnorm" line allows you to select the image formation model.  You
have three choices:

<DL>
  <DT>logarithmic
  <DD>The mass density is linearly related to the logarithm of
    the electron counts.

  <DT>scaled linear
  <DD>The mass density is linearly related to the electron counts.

  <DT>linear
  <DD>The electron counts are used without modification as a measure of
    the mass density.
</DL>

<P>The other control is the pcBase field in the special parameters dialog.
 For the scaled linear or logarithmic image formation models, the value in
that field controls the contribution of an additive term corresponding to a
sheet of uniform mass density.  The
<A HREF="APPL_PRM.html#pcBase">documentation for appl_prm</A> has more
information about the pcBase parameter.

<H2><A NAME="ReconstructionShift">Reconstruction Shift</A></H2>
<P>These three values (they are in units of pixels) shift the imaginary
3D tilt axis of the projection data from its default location; they are
used to center the reconstruction volume on an object of interest.  The
default orientation of the 3D tilt axis has it pass through the point whose
x and y coordinates are the center of the reference projection.

<P><A HREF="#EMTIARGPU">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="ReconstructionZSize">Reconstruction Z Size</A></H2>
<P>This value sets the size of the z dimension, in pixels, for the
reconstructed volume.

<P><A HREF="#EMTIARGPU">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="ReconCyclesPerRun">Recon. Cycles/Run</A></H2>
<P>EMTIARGPU uses either the SART or EM algorithms provided by
<A HREF="GPURECON.html">gpurecon</A> to calculate the reconstruction
from the aligned data.  The value in the "Recon. cycles/run" field is the
number of iterations of the reconstruction algorithm to perform for each run
of the EMTIARGPU steps.

<P><A HREF="#EMTIARGPU">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="RestartRecon">Restart Recon</A></H2>
<P>If the "Restart recon" toggle button is on, the reconstructions in all
iterations after the first do not start with an initial guess.  If the
"Restart recon" button is off, the reconstructions use the reconstruction
result from the previous iteration as the initial guess.  Use the
<A HREF="#InitialGuess">"Initial guess" field</A> to control whether or
not the reconstruction during the first iteration uses an initial guess.

<P>By default, the "Restart recon" toggle button is on.

<P><A HREF="#EMTIARGPU">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="NumberOfRuns">Number of Runs</A></H2>
<P>The value in the "Number of Runs" field is the number of iterations that
should be performed to refine the alignment parameters and reconstruction.

<P><A HREF="#EMTIARGPU">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="TemporaryDirectory">Temporary Directory</A></H2>
<P>The iterative alignment and reconstruction procedure will use the
directory specified in the "Temporary directory" field for storage of
the temporary results: the mass-normalized tilt series from the initialization
step (a floating-point data set which has the same dimensions as the input tilt
series), the aligned tilt series (a floating-point data set whose size is
given by the <A HREF="#AlignedSize">"Aligned size"</A> and
<A HREF="#SectionRange">"Section range"</A> fields), the intermediate
reconstruction (a floating-point data set whose size is given by the
x and y dimensions of the input tilt series and the
<A HREF="#ReconstructionZSize">reconstruction z size</A>), and
the reprojection result (a data set which is the same size as the input
tilt series).  At any given time, the temporary files present will be the
result of the initialization step, if any, and, at most, either an
intermediate reconstruction and aligned tilt series, or an intermediate
reconstruction and reprojection result.

<P>By default, the temporary directory is a directory named tmp in your home
directory.  You might change the temporary directory if you were short on
space in the default directory or the default directory was on a slow disk
and you have a fast disk with enough space for the temporary files.

<P><A HREF="#EMTIARGPU">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="InitialGuess">Initial Guess</A></H2>
<P>To specify an initial guess for the reconstruction, enter the name of the
file containing the initial guess into the "Initial guess" field or press the
adjacent button to launch a file browser to help you select the file.  The
initial guess is optional, if you do not enter anything in the "Initial guess"
field or use "none" as the name of the file, the reconstruction will proceed
without an initial guess.  If you do use an initial guess, its dimensions must
match the dimensions of the reconstruction (i.e. have an x size equal to
the x size of the input tilt series, a y size equal to the the y size of the
input tilt series, and a z size equal to the
<A HREF="#ReconstructionZSize">value in the "Reconstruction Z size" field</A>).

<P><A HREF="#EMTIARGPU">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="CrossCorrelationImages">Cross Correlations</A></H2>
<P>If you select an <A HREF="#AlignmentMethod">alignment method</A> that
includes Talign, the alignment calculations can generate images of the
cross-correlation results, with one cross-correlation image per projection for
the most recent iteration.  If the field labeled "Cross correlations" is not
empty and not set to "none", those cross-correlation images will be written to
an MRC file with the name given in the field.

<P><A HREF="#EMTIARGPU">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="GuessResolution">Guess Resolution</A></H2>
<P>The guess resolution parameter allows you to select which resolution
to use from the <A HREF="#InitialGuess">file containing the initial guess</A>.
The dimensions of the resolution you select must be compatible with the
dimensions you've specified for the reconstruction.

<P><A HREF="#EMTIARGPU">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="StartingRunNumber">Starting Run Number</A></H2>
<P>The iterations of alignment and reconstruction will be numbered from
the value in the "Starting run number" field to the value in the
"Starting run number field" plus the <A HREF="#NumberOfRuns">number of runs</A>
minus one.  That numbering only affects the names of the output alignment
parameter files.  If you had previously done <VAR>n</VAR> iterations and
wanted to see the effect of performing <VAR>m</VAR> more with a record of the
alignment parameters for all of the <VAR>m</VAR> plus <VAR>n</VAR> iterations,
you would set EMTIARGPU so the input alignment parameter file was the output
alignment parameter file from the <VAR>n</VAR>th iteration, the
<A HREF="#NumberOfRuns">number of runs</A> was <VAR>m</VAR>, the starting
run number was <VAR>n</VAR> plus one, and the
<A HREF="#InitialGuess">initial guess</A> was the reconstruction generated
by the previous set of iterations.

<P><A HREF="#EMTIARGPU">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="ResolutionScale">Resolution Scale</A></H2>
<P>The resolution scale parameter controls the scale factor applied to
the alignment parameters and to the size-related input parameters
(<A HREF="#ReconstructionShift">reconstruction shift</A>,
<A HREF="#ReconstructionZSize">reconstruction z size</A>,
<A HREF="#AlignedSize">aligned size</A>, and
<A HREF="#SimplexDeviations">characteristic lengths for the x and y shifts</A>).
In the typical case where you select a resolution level to process from the
main dialog, the resolution scale factor will be set appropriately.  In
the case where you are running the iterative alignment and reconstruction on
a downsampled tilt series but the input alignment parameters are from a higher
resolution version of the data set, you should set the resolution scale to be
the same as the downsampling factor (if the data is scaled down by a factor of
four relative to the coordinates used for the alignment parameters, set the
resolution scale parameter to four) and also adjust the values for the
<A HREF="#FullSize">dimensions of the higher resolution data set</A>.

<P><A HREF="#EMTIARGPU">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="FullSize">Full Size</A></H2>
<P>These two values set the x and y dimensions, in pixels, for the tilt series
corresponding to the alignment parameters in the input alignment parameter
file.  For most cases the user interface can correctly determine these values
from the dimensions of the input tilt series.  One case where you will have
to manually change these values is if you use a downsampled tilt series as
the input to the iterative alignment and reconstruction but the input alignment
parameters correspond to a higher resolution version of the same tilt series.
In that case, you should enter the dimensions, in pixels, of that higher
resolution tilt series in the "Full size" field and also adjust the
<A HREF="#ResolutionScale">resolution scale</A>.

<P><A HREF="#EMTIARGPU">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="AlignedSize">Aligned Size</A></H2>
<P>These two values are, respectively, the x and y dimensions, in pixels, of
the aligned projections.

<P><A HREF="#EMTIARGPU">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="SectionRange">Section Range</A></H2>
<P>These three values set which of the input projections are included in
the reconstruction.  The first value is the index of the first projection
to use, the second value is the index of the last projection to use, and
the third is the index step.  Allowable values for the indices are between
zero and the number of input projections minus one, inclusive.

<P><A HREF="#EMTIARGPU">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="ReconstructionMethod">Reconstruction Method</A></H2>
<P>You have three choices for the reconstruction algorithm.  The choices are:

<DL>
  <DT>backprojection<DD>Computes the reconstruction with a direct
    backprojection of the tilted views.
  <DT>sart<DD>Computes the reconstruction with an iterative algorithm
    which uses an additive update step.
  <DT>em<DD>Computes the reconstruction with an iterative expectation
    maximization algorithm.
</DL>

<P>For the sart and em algorithms, you can use the
<A HREF="#ReconCyclesPerRun">"Recon. Cycles/Run" field</A> to specify the
number of iterations to use and the <A HREF="#Blocks">"Blocks" field</A> to
select a simultaneous form for the algorithm (one block) or a block-iterative
form (two or more blocks) of the algorithm.  You may also specify an initial
guess for the reconstruction with the
<A HREF="#InitialGuess">"Initial guess" field</A>.  The sart and em algorithms
are also affected by your choices for the <A HREF="#Smoothing">smoothing</A>,
<A HREF="#ConvergenceFactor">convergence factor</A>, and
<A HREF="#Slab">slab weighting</A> parameters.  The backprojection algorithm
is not affected by those parameters.  The
<A HREF="#PositivityInterval">positivity interval</A> parameters affects the
sart algorithm but has no effect on the em or backprojection algorithms.  The
backprojection algorithm is affected by your choices for the
<A HREF="#BackprojectionWeight">backprojection weight</A>,
<A HREF="#BackprojectionHamming">backprojection Hamming</A>, and
<A HREF="#BackprojectionParticleSize">particle size</A>.  Those parameters
have no effect on the sart or em algorithms.

<P><A HREF="#EMTIARGPU">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="ProjectionOrder">Projection Order</A></H2>
<P>If you use the <A HREF="#ReconstructionMethod">sart or em algorithms</A>
with more than one <A HREF="#Blocks">block</A>, how the projections are ordered
will have an effect on the result.  There are four options available for
reordering the projections prior to the reconstruction calculation:

<DL>
  <DT>blocked<DD>In effect, sorts the projections into ascending order by tilt
    angle, assembles blocks by taking every <VAR>m</VAR>th projection
    where <VAR>m</VAR> is the number of blocks, and then takes every
    <VAR>j</VAR>th block where j is the maximum of (<VAR>m</VAR> + 1) / 3
    or 2.  This is the default.
  <DT>random<DD>Randomly shuffles the projections.
  <DT>sorted<DD>Sorts the projections into ascending order by tilt angle.
  <DT>as is<DD>Does not reorder the projections:  takes the projections in
    sequence from the input file.
</DL>

<P>For the sart or em algorithms with one block or for the backprojection
algorithm, the effect of the ordering is minimal:  the differences will only
be due to the accumulation of round-off error.

<P><A HREF="#EMTIARGPU">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="ReconCyclesPerRun">Recon. Cycles/Run</A></H2>
<P>If you use the <A HREF="#ReconstructionMethod">sart or em</A> reconstruction
algorithms, the value in the "Recon. cycles/run" field is the number of
iterations of the reconstruction algorithm to perform for each reconstruction.

<P><A HREF="#EMTIARGPU">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Blocks">Blocks</A></H2>
<P>The <A HREF="#ReconstructionMethod">sart or em reconstruction algorithms</A>
can be run in a simultaneous mode or block-iterative mode.  In the simultaneous
mode, each iteration considers all the measurements at once.  In the
block-iterative mode, the measurements are broken into subsets.  At each
iteration the subsets are processed in turn; once all the measurements have
been taken into account, the next iteration begins.  The "Blocks" field sets
the number of subsets to use:  a value of one in that field selects the
simultaneous mode.

<P><A HREF="#EMTIARGPU">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Smoothing">Smoothing</A></H2>
<P>For the <A HREF="#ReconstructionMethod">sart and em algorithms</A>, you can
apply a 3D Gaussian filter to the reconstruction result at the end of each
iteration.  Use the field labeled "Smoothing" in the special parameters dialog
of the graphical user interface to set the standard deviation,
<VAR>sigma</VAR>, for the filter.  The standard deviation must be greater than
or equal to zero.  When zero, no filter will be applied.

<P>Internally, the filter is implemented as a convolution with 5 x 5 x 5
kernel.  When the reconstruction is performed in pieces (either to parallelize
execution or because of memory constraints), the application of the filter is
only approximate:  the pieces are processed independently.  The pieces are
embedded in a slightly larger box (up to 6 elements in the y direction, the
direction used to divide the reconstruction) to account for some of the
blurring effect between pieces.

<P><A HREF="#EMTIARGPU">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="ConvergenceFactor">Convergence Factor</A></H2>
<P>The convergence factor is the scalar by which corrections computed in
the <A HREF="#ReconstructionMethod">sart or em algorithm</A> are multiplied.
The convergence factor can be any value greater than zero or less than or
equal to two.

<P><A HREF="#EMTIARGPU">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="PositivityInterval">Positivity Interval</A></H2>
<P>The current implementation of the GPU reconstruction software accepts this
parameter but does not make use of it.  The intent of the parameter is to
control how often the reconstruction values are coerced to be non-negative in
the <A HREF="#ReconstructionMethod">sart algorithm</A>.  Currently, the values
are coerced to be non-negative after updating the reconstruction with the
correction from a <A HREF="#Blocks">block of views</A>.  With a positivity
interval, <VAR>p</VAR>, greater than one, the reconstruction values would be
coerced to be positive after the updates from <VAR>p</VAR> blocks.

<P>From the graphical user interface, the field labeled, "Positivity interval",
in the special parameters dialog sets the positivity interval.  When the toggle
button next to that field is on, the positivity interval is set equal to the
number of blocks.  The positivity interval must be a positive integer.

<P><A HREF="#EMTIARGPU">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Slab">Slab Weighting</A></H2>
<P>In the computation of projections from a reconstruction, the values are,
by default, rescaled to approximate the contribution from portions of the
sample beyond the reconstruction bounds.  The rescaling assumes that the
reconstruction is portion of a more or less uniform slab of material.  You can
turn on or off the rescaling of the projection values and set the dimensions
and position of the slab.

<P>In the graphical user interface, the menu next to the button labeled
"Slab weighting" controls whether or not the computed projection is rescaled.
That menu is in the special parameters dialog.  The three options are:
<DL>
  <DT>none<DD>Do not rescale the computed projections.  That is the same
    as assuming that no material beyond the bounds of the reconstruction volume
    would make a contribution to the measured projections.
  <DT>default<DD>Rescale the computed projections under the assumption the
    reconstruction is centered in a slab of material with the same height as
    the reconstruction and with a width in x that is very large.
  <DT>custom<DD>Rescale the computed projections under the assumption that
    the reconstruction is part of a slab whose half widths and position are
    given in the adjacent field.
</DL>

<P>The first value in the field for the slab half widths and position is the
half width in x.  The second value in the field is the x position for the
center of the slab.  The third value in the field is the z half width, and the
fourth value in the field is the z position for the center of the slab.  All
of the values are in units of reconstruction samples.  The position of the
center of the slab is measured relative to the point, (0.5 * nx, 0.5 * nz),
of the reconstruction where nx and nz are the number of samples in x and z
for the reconstruction.

<P><A HREF="#EMTIARGPU">Return to overview</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="BackprojectionWeight">Backprojection Weight</A></H2>
<P>For the backprojection reconstruction algorithm, there are five available
choices for how to filter the projections to compensate for the fact that
an average of the backprojected measurements without filtering will
overemphasize the low frequency components from the measurements.  Those
choices are:

<DL>
    <DT>none<DD>With this option, the projection data is not filtered.
      Therefore there is no compensation for the unequal sampling in frequency
      space for the reconstruction and no adjustment for the intensities such
      that projections of the reconstruction have a range of intensities
      similar to the original projection data.
    <DT>elliptical<DD>Can be used with any set of tilt angles and ensures that
      the projections of the reconstruction have similar intensities to the
      original projection data.  The values for the
      <A HREF="#BackprojectionParticleSize">particle size</A> affect this
      weighting function.  You may also use the
      <A HREF="#BackprojectionHamming">option to apply a Hamming filter</A> to
      the projections in conjunction with this weighting function.

and use a <A HREF="#BackprojectionWeight">weighting function</A> different
than "none", then you may specify that a Hamming filter (a one-dimensional
local smoothing filter) be applied to the projections as well prior to the
backprojection.  To turn on the Hamming filter from the graphical user
interface, turn on the toggle button in the special parameters dialog,

<H2><A NAME="BackprojectionParticleSize">Particle Size</A></H2>
<P>If you use the
<A HREF="#ReconstructionMethod">backprojection reconstruction method</A>
with the elliptical or elliptical square weighting function, the weighting
function uses the particle size to account for the approximate spatial bounds
of the object to reconstruct.  The first particle size parameter is the extent
in x, and the second particle size parameter and the second is the extent in z.
Both have units of pixels.  By default, the particle size parameters are set to
the same size as the reconstruction bounds.

    translations followed by a simplex optimization of all parameters.
  <DT>Talign<DD>Use a FFT-based cross-correlation to determine the

<P>If the "Offset" toggle button is on and you have selected an
<A HREF="#AlignmentMethod">alignment method</A> that includes Talign, a shift
along the tilt axis will be induced with the intent of keeping the peak
corresponding to the best shift parameters (that peak would likely be near the
origin if the input alignment parameters are sufficiently good) away from the
origin which receives special treatment.  Before the alignment parameters are
written out, the program compensates them for the induced shift.  When the
"Offset" toggle button is off, no shift along the tilt axis is induced when
using one of the methods which include Talign.

<P>When you use <A HREF="#PhaseWeighting">phase weighting</A> of the
cross-correlations, there is a term like that in a Wiener filter to keep things
well behaved when the amplitude of the cross-correlation value in the frequency
domain approaches zero.  The term is an estimate of the high-frequency power
spectral density times the value in the user interface's "Wiener coefficient"
field.  A higher value for the "Wiener coefficient" increases the suppression
of the low amplitude components.  The default value is 100.

<H2><A NAME="CenterPeakDistance">Center Peak Distance</A></H2>
<P>With the <A HREF="#AlignmentMethod">alignment methods</A> that include
Talign, the alignment algorithm will try to cancel out the effect of a peak
at the origin by subtracting out a radial average over the central 7 x 7
region from that region.  The alignment application only performs that
subtraction if the largest value in the central 7 x 7 region occurs at the
center and the quadratic fit to that point and its four nearest neighbors
gives a peak position, (xp, yp), where both the absolute value of xp and yp
are less than a threshold value.  The threshold value is, by default, 0.05
pixels,  You can change the threshold by modifying the value in the
"Center peak distance" field.

(after masking out the origin) has a height less than <VAR>f</VAR> times the
height of the peak at the origin.  The default value of <VAR>f</VAR> is .001.

<P>These six parameters set the characteristic length for each of the six
alignment parameters that can be refined when aligning a section from the
tilt series to a section from the reprojection.  A characteristic length
scale of zero for a parameter causes the simplex method to not refine that
parameter; in the graphical user interface, you turn on or off the refinement
of a parameter with the toggle button adjacent to the field which displays the
characteristic length.  The six alignment parameters are the x shift (in
pixels), y shift (in pixels), rotation (in degrees), isotropic magnification
factor, the orientation angle for the anisotropic stretching axis (in degrees),
and the anisotropic stretching factor.  The first four parameters have a
direct effect on the output alignment parameters.  The last two (the
orientation of the anisotropic stretching direction and the anisotropic
stretching factor) do not.

<H2><A NAME="CommandLine">Command Line</A></H2>
<P>EMTIARGPU simply generates a script that call rgemt_autostart, which is
used to start and stop the reconstruction server software, and that, in
turn, calls the command-line application, emtiar_gpu, which implements the
iterative alignment and reconstruction.  The command-line syntax for using
rgemt_autostart with emtiar_gpu is (optional parts are enclosed in brackets):

<PRE>
    rgemt_autostart <VAR>input_tilt_series</VAR> \
        <VAR>input_align_param</VAR> <VAR>output_align_param_base</VAR> \
        <VAR>output_recon</VAR> [emtiar_gpu_options] \
        -rgemt_client=emtiar_gpu [rgemt_autostart_options]
</PRE>

<P>The <A HREF="Parallel.html#GPUParallel">"GPU Parallel Settings" section of
Parallel.html</A> describes rgemt_autostart and the options it accepts.  The
options tha emtiar_gpu understands are:

<DL>
  <DT><CODE>-block=</CODE><VAR>n</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the number of subsets to use with the
    <A HREF="#ReconstructionMethod">em or sart reconstruction algorithms</A>
    to be <VAR>n</VAR>.  <VAR>n</VAR> must be greater than or equal to one.

  <DT><CODE>-bpfilter=</CODE><VAR>f</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the type of filtering done to the projections for the
    <A HREF="#ReconstructionMethod">backprojection reconstruction algorithm</A>.
    <VAR>f</VAR> must be <CODE>none</CODE>, <CODE>elliptical</CODE>,
    <CODE>elliptical-square</CODE>, <CODE>rstar</CODE>, or
    <CODE>rstar-hamming</CODE>.  If you do not include a -bpfilter option
    when using the command line, the reconstruction will not filter the
    projections.

  <DT><CODE>-bphamming</CODE>
  <DD>If using the
    <A HREF="#ReconstructionMethod">backprojection reconstruction algorithm</A>
    with filtering of the projection data (-bpfilter= is not set to none),
    this option causes a Hamming filter to be applied to the projections in
    addition to the other filtering.

  <DT><CODE>-bpparticle=</CODE><VAR>x</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>z</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the <A HREF="#BackprojectionParticleSize">particle size</A> used
    for the elliptical or elliptical-square filters of the projection data
    in the <A HREF="#ReconstructionMethod">backprojection reconstruction algorithm</A>.  If you do not use this option, the particle has the same dimensions
    as the reconstruction.

  <DT><CODE>-convf=</CODE><VAR>f</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the convergence factor for the
    <A HREF="#ReconstructionMethod">em or sart reconstruction algorithms</A>
    to be <VAR>f</VAR>.  <VAR>f</VAR> must be greater than zero and less than
    or equal to two.  By default, emtiar_gpu uses a convergence factor of one.
    emtiar_gpu also accepts the form, <CODE>-convf=</CODE><VAR>fname</VAR>,
    where <VAR>fname</VAR> is the name of a text file which contains at least
    <VAR>m</VAR> floating-point values separated by whitespace.  <VAR>m</VAR>
    is the <A HREF="#Blocks">number of blocks</A> multiplied by the
    <A HREF="#ReconCyclesPerRun">number of cycles per reconstruction</A>.
    The <VAR>i</VAR>th value in the file will be used as the relaxation factor
    for the update from the <VAR>j</VAR>th block, <VAR>j</VAR> =
    1 + ((<VAR>i</VAR> - 1) modulo the number of blocks), in the
    <VAR>k</VAR>th cycle, <VAR>k</VAR> = 1 + ((<VAR>i</VAR> - 1) divided by
    the number of blocks).

  <DT><CODE>-cor_out=</CODE><VAR>fname</VAR>
  <DD>If <VAR>fname</VAR> is not empty and not equal to "none" and an alignment
    method including Talign is selected, images of the cross-correlation
    results for the most recent iteration will be written to an MRC file named
    <VAR>fname</VAR>.

  <DT><CODE>-cpd=</CODE><VAR>d</VAR>
  <DD>To reduce the effect of a central peak, the Talign algorithm will
    subtract off a radial average from the central 7 x 7 if the brightest
    point in the central 7 x 7 occurs at the center and a quadratic fit
    to the center and its four nearest neighbors gives a peak position,
    (xp, yp), where the absolute values of xp and yp are less than
    <VAR>d</VAR>.  The default value of <VAR>d</VAR> is 0.05 pixels.

  <DT><CODE>-cycles=</CODE><VAR>n</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the <A HREF="#ReconCyclesPerRun">number of cycles of reconstruction
    to use for every iteration</A> to be <VAR>n</VAR>.  By default, emtiar_gpu
    uses 20 cycles of reconstruction per iteration.

  <DT><CODE>-dev=</CODE><VAR>xs</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>ys</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>rot</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>mag</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>axis</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>stretch</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the <A HREF="#SimplexDeviations">characteristic length for each of
    the six alignment parameters</A> that can be refined when aligning a
    section from the tilt series to a section from the reprojection.  By
    default, emtiar_gpu uses a characteristic length of one pixel for the x
    and y shift, a characteristic length of zero degrees for the rotation and
    orientation of the asymmetric stretching axis, and a characteristic length
    of zero for the magnification and asymmetric stretching factor.

  <DT><CODE>-dimxy=</CODE><VAR>nx</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>ny</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the <A HREF="#AlignedSize">x and y dimensions of the aligned
    projections</A>, in pixels.  By default, emtiar_gpu uses the same
    dimensions as the input tilt series.

  <DT><CODE>-fullsize=</CODE><VAR>nx</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>ny</VAR>
  <DD>Specifies the dimensions, in pixels, of the tilt series corresponding
    to the alignment parameters in the input alignment parameter file.  If you
    do not set this option, emtiar_gpu will use the dimensions of the highest
    resolution in the input tilt series.  A case where you would want to
    use values other than the defaults is when the input tilt series has been
    downsampled and the input alignment parameters are for a higher resolution
    of the tilt series.  In that case you would also want to specify the
    -rscale option as well.

  <DT><CODE>-gres=</CODE><VAR>i</VAR>
  <DD>Selects the resolution <VAR>i</VAR> from the initial guess specified by
    -istrfile.  <VAR>i</VAR> must be a non-negative integer less than the
    number of resolutions in that file.

  <DT><CODE>-imform=</CODE><VAR>code</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the <A HREF="#ApplyMassnorm">image formation model</A> used during
    the initialization step.  Valid values for <VAR>code</VAR> are:
    <DL>
      <DT>0<DD>logarithmic (the default if the input parameter file contains
        mass-normalization parameters)
      <DT>1<DD>scaled linear
      <DT>2<DD>linear (the default if the input parameter file does not
        contain mass-normalization parameters)
    </DL>

  <DT><CODE>-imod=</CODE><VAR>m</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the method to use for alignment.  <VAR>m</VAR> may be one of
    the values listed below.
    <DL>
      <DT>0<DD>Use Talign (a FFT-based cross-correlation) to determine the
        translations followed by a simplex optimization of all parameters.
      <DT>1<DD>Use Talign (a FFT-based cross-correlation) to determine the
        translations.  The other parameters are not modified.  This is the
        default.
      <DT>2<DD>Use a simplex optimization of all parameters.
    </DL>

  <DT><CODE>-istrfile=</CODE><VAR>file</VAR>
  <DD>Specifies that the initial guess for the reconstructed volume should
    be read from <VAR>file</VAR>.

  <DT><CODE>-iv=</CODE><VAR>ivstart</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>ivend</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>ivstep</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the <A HREF="#SectionRange">range of input projections</A> included
    in the reconstruction.  By default, emtiar_gpu includes all the projections
    present in the input tilt series.

  <DT><CODE>-method=</CODE><VAR>m</VAR>
  <DD>Selects the reconstruction algorithm to use.  <VAR>m</VAR> may be
    either backprojection, sart, or em.  If you do not set this option, the
    sart algorithm is used.

  <DT><CODE>-missingx=</CODE><VAR>xhw</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>xpos</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the xhalf width, <VAR>xhw</VAR>, and x position, <VAR>xpos</VAR>, of
    the slab used to determine the
    <A HREF="#Slab">rescaling for computed projection data</A>.
    Both values are in reconstruction samples.  The position is relative
    to the coordinate, 0.5 * nx, of the reconstruction.  nx is the number of
    samples in x.  If the half width and position are not set, emtiar_gpu will
    use a half width of 3.40282 x 10^38 and a position of zero.
     
  <DT><CODE>-missingz=</CODE><VAR>zhw</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>xpos</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the z half width, <VAR>zhw</VAR>, and z position, <VAR>zpos</VAR>,
    of the slab used to determine the
    <A HREF="#Slab">rescaling for computed projection data</A>.
    Both values are in reconstruction samples.  The position is relative
    to the coordinate, 0.5 * nz, of the reconstruction.  nz is the number of
    samples in z.  If the half width and position are not set, emtiar_gpu will
    use a half width of 0.5 * nz and a position of zero.
     
  <DT><CODE>-mult=</CODE><VAR>s</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the scale factor, <VAR>s</VAR>, for the noise component when
    performing phase weighting in an alignment method that uses Talign.
    The default value for the scale factor is one hundred.

  <DT><CODE>-multires</CODE>
  <DD>Causes the generated reconstruction to have multiple resolutions if the
    x and y dimensions of the reconstruction are large enough.

  <DT><CODE>-nofilter</CODE>
  <DD>If specified, a highpass filter is not applied when you use simplex
    optimization in the alignment; otherwise, a highpass filter is applied
    when you use simplex optimization.

  <DT><CODE>-nooffset</CODE>
  <DD>If specified, no offset along the tilt axis is applied when you use
    one of the alignment methods which include Talign; otherwise, an offset
    is applied along the tilt axis and then compensated for prior to writing
    out the alignment parameters.

  <DT><CODE>-nomissing</CODE>
  <DD>Disables <A HREF="#Slab">rescaling of computed projection
    data</A>.  When you set this option, any -missingx or -missingz options
    you supply will not affect the computations.

  <DT><CODE>-pcbase=</CODE><VAR>b</VAR>
  <DD>Sets <A HREF="#ApplyMassnorm">a factor</A> that comes into play if the
    scaled linear or logarithmic image formation model is used during the
    initialization step.  By default, emtiar_gpu assumes a value of 0.05.

  <DT><CODE>-permute=</CODE><VAR>ptype</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the order in which the tilted views are included in the
    reconstruction calculations.  If the reconstruction algorithm is
    backprojection or the algorithm processes all of the views in one block,
    the ordering of the views only affects the result because of differences
    in the accumulation of rounding errors.  If the reconstruction algorithm
    is sart or em and multiple blocks are used, changing the ordering could
    have a bigger effect on the reconstruction.  <VAR>ptype</VAR> must be one
    of the following:  block1, random, sorted, or none.  The
    <A HREF="#ProjectionOrder">projection order topic</A> describes each of
    those orderings in more detail.  If you do not use the -permute option, the
    block1 order is the default.

  <DT><CODE>-phaseweight</CODE>
  <DD>If specified, phase weighting is done when you use an alignment method
    that includes Talign; otherwise, phase weighting is not done.

  <DT><CODE>-posintvl=</CODE><VAR>p</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the <A HREF="#PositivityInterval">positivity interval</A> for the
    <A HREF="#ReconstructionMethod">sart reconstruction algorithm</A>.
    <VAR>p</VAR> must be a positive integer.  If not set, the positivity
    interval defaults to a value of one.

  <DT><CODE>-reconz=</CODE><VAR>nz</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the <A HREF="#ReconstructionZSize">z dimension of the
    reconstruction</A>, in pixels.  By default, the z dimension is one
    fourth the size of the x dimension of the input tilt series.

  <DT><CODE>-res=</CODE><VAR>i</VAR>
  <DD>Selects <VAR>i</VAR> as the resolution to process from the input tilt
    series.  <VAR>i</VAR> must be a non-negative integer less than the number
    of resolution in the tilt series.  Other command-line options affecting
    the processing of different resolutions are -rscale, -fullsize, and -gres,
    but, in normal circumstances, it is sufficient to use -res by itself.  If
    you do not specify this option, the highest resolution (zero) is processed.

  <DT><CODE>-restart_recon</CODE>
  <DD>If specified, reconstructions for iterations other than the first
    do not start with an initial guess.

  <DT><CODE>-rscale</CODE>=<VAR>i</VAR>
  <DD>Controls the scale factor (1.0 / <VAR>i</VAR>) applied to the alignment
    parameters and size-related input parameters to compensate for processing
    a lower resolution.  <VAR>i</VAR> must be a positive integer.  If you do
    not set this option, <VAR>i</VAR> defaults to be two raised to the power
    of the resolution level selected with -res.  A case where you would want
    to use a value different than the default is when the input tilt series
    has been downsampled and the input alignment parameters are for a higher
    resolution of the tilt series.  In that case you would also want to
    specify the -fullsize option as well.

  <DT><CODE>-runs=</CODE><VAR>n</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the number of iterations of refinement to perform.  By default,
    emtiar_gpu will perform a single iteration.

  <DT><CODE>-server=</CODE><VAR>address</VAR>
  <DD>If you run emtiar_gpu under rgemt_autostart, rgemt_autostart intercepts
    any -server= options and rewrites them before passing them to emtiar_gpu.
    For each -server option passed to it, emtiar_gpu attempts to contact an
    instance of the reconstruction server software and have it perform a
    portion of the calculations.  <VAR>address</VAR> must have the form
    of an internet host name or IP address followed, optionally, by a colon
    and the TCP port number to use when contacting the server.  If emtiar_gpu
    is not given any -server options, it will look at the value of the
    environment variable, RGEMT_SERVER_LIST, and interpret it as a
    comma-separated list of addresses.

  <DT><CODE>-shxzy=</CODE><VAR>xshift</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>yshift</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>zshift</VAR>
  <DD>Specifies the <A HREF="#ReconstructionShift">shift, in pixels, of the
    reconstructed volume</A> from the default position.  By default, emtiar_gpu
    does not shift the reconstructed volume.

  <DT><CODE>-skip_init</CODE>
  <DD>Disables the initialization step for computing a mass-normalized tilt
    series.

  <DT><CODE>-smooth=</CODE><VAR>s</VAR>
  <DD>If the reconstruction algorithm is sart or em, causes a Gaussian filter
    with a standard deviation of <VAR>s</VAR> to be applied to the
    reconstuction at each iteration of the reconstruction algorithm.  By
    default, emtiar_gpu does not filter apply a Gaussian filter to the
    reconstruction.  The <A HREF="#Smoothing">smoothing topic</A> describes
    the limitations of the filter's implementation.

  <DT><CODE>-spth=</CODE><VAR>t</VAR>
  <DD>In the Talign algorithm, cross-correlation peaks away from the origin are
    preferred.  A peak at the origin is only accepted if the next highest
    peak (after masking out the origin) has a height less than <VAR>t</VAR>
    times the height of the peak at the origin.  The default value for
    <VAR>t</VAR> is .001.

  <DT><CODE>-start=</CODE><VAR>i</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the <A HREF="#StartingRunNumber">number to associate with the first
    iteration</A>.  By default, emtiar_gpu will use a value of one.

  <DT><CODE>-tmpdir=</CODE><VAR>directory</VAR>
  <DD>Sets the
    <A HREF="#TemporaryDirectory">directory used for temporary files</A>.
    By default, emtiar_gpu places the temporary files in a directory named tmp
    within your home directory.
