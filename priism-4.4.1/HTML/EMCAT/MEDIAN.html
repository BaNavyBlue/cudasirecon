<H1><A NAME="MEDIAN">EMTAR's Median Filter</A></H1>
<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>The processing pipeline for alignment and reconstruction of EM tomography
data includes the option to run a median smoothing filter on the raw data
before passing it to the alignment, mass-normalization and tilt axis
determination calculations.  The reconstruction is still done with the raw
data.

<P>The median filter in the pipeline is
<A HREF="../Filter2D.html">Priism's Filter2D</A> using the median filter
option with the enhance mode off.  There are two input parameters.  One
selects the dimension in full resolution pixels of the square region in the
input that affects the value at pixel in the output.  Using a larger kernel
size results in a smoother (more heavily filtered) result.  The second
parameter selects which resolution (zero is the highest) to process from
the input file.
