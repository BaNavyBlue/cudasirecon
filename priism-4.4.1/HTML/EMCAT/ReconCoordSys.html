<H1>Coordinate System for EM Tomography Reconstructions</H1>
<P>Priism's applications for reconstructing EM tomograms use this relationship
between a coordinate, (xv, yv, zv), in the reconstruction volume and its
projection, (xp, yp), to the aligned coordinate grid for the tilt angle, ta:

<PRE>
    [ xp ]   [ cos(ta)  0  sin(ta) ] [ xv-0.5*(nxv-1) ]   [ 0.5*(nxp-1) ]
    [    ] = [                     ] [       yv       ] + [             ]
    [ yp ]   [    0     1     0    ] [ zv-0.5*(nxv-1) ]   [      0      ]
</PRE>

<P>nxv and nzv are the number of samples along the x and z axes, respectively,
of the reconstruction.  nxp is the number of samples along the x axis of the
aligned projection.

<P>All of Priism's applications for reconstructing EM tomograms assume the
projections have been aligned such that the tilt axis is parallel to the y
axis.  The <A HREF="APPL_PRM.html#ApplyAlignment">section titled, Apply
Alignment, of APPL_PRM.html</A> describes the coordinate transformations used
to map the unaligned projections to the aligned coordinate system.

<P>Given two planes, z = z1 and z = z2, with z1 greater than z2 from the
reconstruction of a sample measured with an underfocus, the convention
<A HREF="PFOCUSRAMP.html#Defocus">for the change in defocus</A> used by
Priism's CTF correction application, <A HREF="PFOCUSRAMP.html">pfocusramp</A>,
implies that the plane at z1 had less of an underfocus at zero tilt than the
plane at z2.
