<H1><A NAME="GPURECON">GPURECON</A></H1>
<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>GPURECON is a client application that contacts one or more remote servers
to have the servers perform a reconstruction calculation.  The current
servers use graphics cards to accelerate the calculation, thus the name
GPURECON.  GPURECON generates reconstructions in a non-flipped (x, y, and
then z) orientation rather than the flipped orientation (x, z, and then y)
produced by the stand-alone reconstruction applications,
<A HREF="EWBP.html">EWBP</A> and <A HREF="TAPIR.html">TAPIR</A>.

<P>The actual reconstruction calculations can use one of three algorithms.
You select which one to use with the <A HREF="#Method">"Method" menu</A>.
The backprojection algorithm is similar to the algorithm used by
<A HREF="EWBP.html">EWBP</A>.  The
<A HREF="#BackprojectionWeight">backprojection weight</A>,
<A HREF="#BackprojectionHamming">backprojection Hamming</A>, and
<A HREF="#BackprojectionParticleSize">particle size</A> options in the
special parameters dialog affect the output of the backprojection algorithm.
The sart and em algorithms are iterative algorithms.  You should set the
<A HREF="#Cycles">number of iterations</A> to perform.  You may also specify
an initial guess for those two algorithms.  The sart algorithm with a
<A HREF="#Blocks">block size of one</A> and a
<A HREF="#ConvergenceFactor">convergence factor of one</A> is similar to the
algorithm used by <A HREF="TAPIR.html">TAPIR</A>.

<P>Use the <A HREF="Parallel.html#GPUParallel">button labeled "GPU execution settings..."</A>
in EMTAR's main dialog and the adjacent toggle button to access the dialog
that controls how GPURECON determines which servers to use and other parameters
related to the configuration of those servers.

<P>On the command line, you should normally run GPURECON through the helper
utility, rgemt_autostart.  That utility is described in the
<A HREF="Parallel.html#GPUParallel">"GPU Parallel Settings" section of Parallel.html</A>.
Here's a sample command file for GPURECON and rgemt_autostart to have three
servers perform a reconstruction similar to what
<A HREF="TAPIR.html">TAPIR</A> would produce:
<PRE>
    ( time rgemt_autostart \

<H2><A NAME="AlignedSeries">Aligned Series</A></H2>
<P>This is the name of the input file which contains the mass normalized and
aligned projection series created by <A HREF="APPL_PRM.html">APPL_PRM</A>.
On the command line, the name of the file with mass-normalized and aligned
data is the first argument.

<P><A HREF="#Parameters">Return to the list of parameters</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Reconstruction">Reconstruction</A></H2>
<P>This is the name of the file that will contain the data for the
reconstructed volume.  On the command line, the name of for the output image
data is the second argument.

<P><A HREF="#Parameters">Return to the list of parameters</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="NX:NY:NV">NX:NY:NV</A></H2>
<P>The first two values are, respectively, the x and y dimensions of the
data in <A HREF="#AlignedSeries">the input projection series</A>.  The last
value is the number of projections in the series.

<P><A HREF="#Parameters">Return to the list of parameters</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="OutputXZSize">Output XZ Size</A></H2>
<P>These two values set the x and z dimensions, in pixels, of the
reconstructed volume.  If the initial reconstruction guess is supplied as an
input (with the <A HREF="#InitialGuess">initial guess parameter</A>), then
these dimensions should match the x and z dimensions of that file.

<P>On the command line, use
<CODE>-reconxz=</CODE><VAR>nx</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>nz</VAR> to set
the x and z dimensions of the reconstruction.  When <VAR>nx</VAR> is not set,
the x dimension of the reconstructed volume is the same as the x dimension of
the input data. When <VAR>nz</VAR> is not set, the z dimension of the
reconstructed volume is one fourth of the x dimension of the input data.

<P><A HREF="#Parameters">Return to the list of parameters</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="YRange">Y Range</A></H2>
<P>These two values set the range of y pixels from the
<A HREF="#AlignedSeries">aligned tilt series</A> to use in the reconstruction.
The first is the first index (running from 0 to the number of y pixels minus
one) to use, and the second is the last possible index to use.  If you supply
an <A HREF="#InitialGuess">initial guess</A>, the y dimension of the guess
must match that specified with these values.

<P>On the command line, Use
<CODE>-iy=</CODE><VAR>start_index</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>last_index</VAR>
to set the y range.  If you do not specify a range, all y pixels are used:
<VAR>start_index</VAR> is set to zero and <VAR>last_index</VAR> is set to
the number of y pixels minus one.

<P><A HREF="#Parameters">Return to the list of parameters</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Method">Method</A></H2>
<P>You have three choices for the reconstruction algorithm when you use
GPURECON.  The choices are:

<DL>
  <DT>backprojection<DD>Computes the reconstruction from a direct
    backprojection of the tilted views.  This is the fastest algorithm but
    typically suffers from lower contrast and resolution than the other
    methods.  The reconstructions with this algorithm should be very similar
    to the results from <A HREF="EWBP.html">EWBP</A>.  Consult the
    <A HREF="#BackprojectionWeight">backprojection weight</A>,
    <A HREF="#BackprojectionHamming">backprojection Hamming</A>,
    and <A HREF="#BackprojectionParticleSize">particle size</A> topics for
    information about the options that affect the backprojection algorithm.
    On the command line, use the option, <CODE>-method=backprojection</CODE>,
    to select this method.
  <DT>sart<DD>Computes the reconstruction with an iterative algorithm
    with an additive update step.  With a <A HREF="#Blocks">single block</A>
    and a <A HREF="#ConvergenceFactor">convergence factor</A> of one, the
    algorithm should give similar results to <A HREF="TAPIR.html">TAPIR</A>.
    On the command line, use the option, <CODE>-method=sart</CODE>, to select
    this method.
  <DT>em<DD>Computes the reconstruction with an iterative expectation
    maximization algorithm.  On the command line, use the option,
    <CODE>-method=em</CODE>, to select this method.
</DL>

<P>For the sart and em algorithms, you can use the
<A HREF="#Cycles">"Cycles" field</A> to specify the number of iterations to
use, the <A HREF="#Blocks">"Blocks" field</A> to select a simultaneous form
for the algorithm (one block) or a block-iterative form (two or more blocks) of
the algorithm, and the <A HREF="#InitialGuess">"Initial guess"</A>
field to supply the file name of an initial guess.  Your choice for the
<A HREF="#ConvergenceFactor">convergence factor</A>,
<A HREF="#Smooth">smoothing</A>, and <A HREF="#SlabWeighting">slab
weighting</A> affects the sart and em algorithms.  It has no effect on the
backprojection algorithm.  The
<A HREF="#ProjectionOrder">ordering of the projections</A> will have an
effect for the sart or em algorithms when you use more than one block; in other
cases, the ordering of the projections will have a minimal effect (the only
differences will be due to round-off error).  The
<A HREF="#PositivityInterval">positivity interval</A> will affect the sart
algorithm.

<P><A HREF="#Parameters">Return to the list of parameters</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="InitialGuess">Initial Guess</A></H2>
<P>This is the name of a file containing the initial reconstruction guess;
GPURECON only uses the initial guess if you do not select the
<A HREF="#Method">backprojection method</A>.  The initial guess is optional;
when <EM>none</EM> is used as the file name, it is assumed that there is no
initial guess available.

<P>If the initial guess is supplied, its dimensions must match the
dimensions of the output reconstruction as set by the
<A HREF="#OutputXZSize">output XZ size</A> and <A HREF="#YRange">y range</A>
input parameters.  The initial guess must also be in the same unflipped
orientation as the output reconstruction.

<P>To set the file name for the initial guess on the command line, use
<CODE>-istrfile=</CODE><VAR>filename</VAR>.  If you do not specify a
<CODE>-istrfile</CODE> option, GPURECON will assume that no initial guess
is available.

<P><A HREF="#Parameters">Return to the list of parameters</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Cycles">Cycles</A></H2>
<P>This parameter sets the maximum number of iterations that are performed
for the <A HREF="#Method">sart or em algorithms</A>.

<P>On the command line, use <CODE>-cycles=</CODE><VAR>n</VAR> to perform
<VAR>n</VAR> iterations.  If you do not supply a <CODE>-cycles</CODE> option,
GPURECON will perform one iteration.

<P><A HREF="#Parameters">Return to the list of parameters</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Blocks">Blocks</A></H2>
<P>GPURECON's <A HREF="#Method">sart and em algorithms</A> can be run in a
simultaneous mode or block-iterative mode.  In the simultaneous mode, each
iteration considers all the measurements at once.  In the block-iterative
mode, the measurements are broken into subsets.  At each iteration the subsets
are processed in turn; once all the measurements have been taken into account,
the next iteration begins.  The "Blocks" field sets the number of subsets
to use:  a value of one in that field selects the simultaneous mode.

<P>On the command line, use <CODE>-block=</CODE><VAR>n</VAR> to have GPURECON
use <VAR>n</VAR> subsets for the sart or em algorithms.  If you do not supply a
<CODE>-blocks</CODE> option, GPURECON will use one block.

<P><A HREF="#Parameters">Return to the list of parameters</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="ConvergenceFactor">Convergence Factor</A></H2>
<P>The convergence factor is the scalar by which corrections after the first
computed in the <A HREF="#Method">sart and em algorithms</A> are multiplied.
If you supply an <A HREF="#InitialGuess">initial guess</A> for the
reconstruction, the convergence factor is also used for the first correction.
Otherwise, the first correction is used without modification.  Convergence
factors greater than zero and less than or equal to two are accepted by
GPURECON.  You can set the convergence factor from the graphical user
interface by editing the value in the field labeled "Convergence".

<P>On the command line, include <CODE>-convf=</CODE><VAR>f</VAR> in the
options to set the convergence factor to be the floating-point value,
<VAR>f</VAR>.  The command line also accepts the form,
<CODE>-convf=</CODE><VAR>fname</VAR>, where <VAR>fname</VAR> is the name of a
text file which contains at least <VAR>m</VAR> floating-point values separated
by whitespace.  <VAR>m</VAR> is the <A HREF="#Blocks">number of blocks</A>
multiplied by the <A HREF="#Cycles">number of cycles</A>.  The <VAR>i</VAR>th
value in the file will be used as the relaxation factor for the update from
the <VAR>j</VAR>th block, <VAR>j</VAR> = 1 + ((<VAR>i</VAR> - 1) modulo the
number of blocks), in the <VAR>k</VAR>th cycle, <VAR>k</VAR> = 1 +
((<VAR>i</VAR> - 1) divided by the number of blocks).

<P><A HREF="#Parameters">Return to the list of parameters</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Smooth">Smooth</A></H2>
<P>For the <A HREF="#Method">sart and em algorithms</A>, you can apply a 3D
Gaussian filter to the reconstruction result at the end of each iteration.
Use the field labeled "Smooth" in the graphical user interface or, on the
command line, include <CODE>-smooth=</CODE><VAR>sigma</VAR> in the options, to
set the standard deviation, <VAR>sigma</VAR>, for the filter.  The standard
deviation must be greater than or equal to zero.  When zero, no filter will be
applied.

<P>Internally, the filter is implemented as a convolution with 5 x 5 x 5
kernel.  When the reconstruction is performed in pieces (either to parallelize
execution or because of memory constraints), the application of the filter is
only approximate:  the pieces are processed independently.  The pieces are
embedded in a slightly larger box (up to 6 elements in the y direction, the
direction used to divide the reconstruction) to account for some of the
blurring effect between pieces.

<P><A HREF="#Parameters">Return to the list of parameters</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="ProjectionOrder">Projection Order</A></H2>
<P>If you use the <A HREF="#Method">sart or em algorithms</A> with
more than one <A HREF="#Blocks">block</A>, how the projections are ordered
will have an effect on the result.  There are four options available for
reordering the projections prior to the reconstruction calculation:

<DL>
  <DT>blocked<DD>In effect, sorts the projections into ascending order by tilt
    angle, assembles blocks by taking every <VAR>m</VAR>th projection
    where <VAR>m</VAR> is the number of blocks, and then takes every
    <VAR>j</VAR>th block where j is the maximum of (<VAR>m</VAR> + 1) / 3
    or 2.  This is the default.
  <DT>random<DD>Randomly shuffles the projections.
  <DT>sorted<DD>Sorts the projections into ascending order by tilt angle.
  <DT>as is<DD>Does not reorder the projections:  takes the projections in
    sequence from the input file.
</DL>

<P>For the sart or em algorithms with one block or for the backprojection
algorithm, the effect of the ordering is minimal:  the differences will only
be due to the accumulation of round-off error.

<P>On the command-line, use
<PRE>
    <CODE>-permute=</CODE><VAR>p</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>to set the ordering.  <VAR>p</VAR> must be <CODE>block1</CODE> (for the
blocked mode), <CODE>random</CODE>, <CODE>sorted</CODE>, or <CODE>none</CODE>
(for the as is mode).

<P><A HREF="#Parameters">Return to the list of parameters</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="SlabWeighting">Slab Weighting</A></H2>
<P>The <A HREF="#Method">sart and em</A> algorithms compare computed
projections of the reconstruction to the measured projections and, by default,
rescale the computed projections to approximate the contribution from portions
of the sample beyond the reconstruction bounds.  The rescaling assumes that the
reconstruction is portion of a more or less uniform slab of material.  You can
turn on or off the rescaling of the projection values and set the dimensions
and position of the slab.

<P>In the graphical user interface, the menu next to the button labeled
"Slab weighting" controls whether or not the computed projection is rescaled.
That menu is in the special parameters dialog.  The three options are:
<DL>
  <DT>none<DD>Do not rescale the computed projections.  That is the same
    as assuming that no material beyond the bounds of the reconstruction volume
    would make a contribution to the measured projections.
  <DT>default<DD>Rescale the computed projections under the assumption the
    reconstruction is centered in a slab of material with the same height as
    the reconstruction and with a width in x that is very large.
  <DT>custom<DD>Rescale the computed projections under the assumption that
    the reconstruction is part of a slab whose half widths and position are
    given in the adjacent field.
</DL>

<P>The first value in the field for the slab half widths and position is the
half width in x.  The second value in the field is the x position for the
center of the slab.  The third value in the field is the z half width, and the
fourth value in the field is the z position for the center of the slab.  All
of the values are in units of reconstruction samples.  The position of the
center of the slab is measured relative to the point, (0.5 * nx, 0.5 * nz),
of the reconstruction where nx and nz are the number of samples in x and z
for the reconstruction.

<P>On the command line, include <CODE>-nomissing</CODE> in the options to
disable rescaling of the computed projections.  Otherwise, rescaling will be
done and the half widths and position of the slab can be set by including
<CODE>-missingx=</CODE><VAR>xhw</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>xpos</VAR>
and <CODE>-missingz=</CODE><VAR>zhw</VAR><CODE>:</CODE><VAR>zpos</VAR> in the
options.  <VAR>xhw</VAR> is the desired half width in x, <VAR>xpos</VAR> is
the x coordinate for the center of the slab, <VAR>zhw</VAR> is the desired
half width in z, and <VAR>zpos</VAR> is the z coordinate for the center of the
slab.  All of those values are in units of reconstruction samples.  The
positions are relative to the point, (0.5 * nx, 0.5 * nz), of the
reconstruction where nx and nz are the number of samples in x and z for the
reconstruction.  If the x half width and x position are not set, the x
half width will be 3.40282 x 10^38, and the x position will be zero.  If the
z half width and z position are not set, the z half width will be 0.5 times the
number of samples in z for the reconstruction, and the z position will be zero.

<P><A HREF="#Parameters">Return to the list of parameters</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="PositivityInterval">Positivity Interval</A></H2>
<P>The current implementation of the GPU reconstruction software accepts this
parameter but does not make use of it.  The intent of the parameter is to
control how often the reconstruction values are coerced to be non-negative in
the <A HREF="#Method">sart algorithm</A>.  Currently, the values are coerced
to be non-negative after updating the reconstruction with the correction
from a <A HREF="#Blocks">block of views</A>.  With a positivity interval,
<VAR>p</VAR>, greater than one, the reconstruction values would be coerced to
be positive after the updates from <VAR>p</VAR> blocks.

<P>From the graphical user interface, the field labeled, "Positivity interval",
in the special parameters dialog sets the positivity interval.  When the toggle
button next to that field is on, the positivity interval is set equal to the
number of blocks.  On the command line, you can set the positivity interval to
be <VAR>p</VAR> by including <CODE>-posintvl=</CODE><VAR>p</VAR> in the
options.  When you do not set the inverval from the command line, an interval
equal to the number of blocks will be used.  From either the graphical user
interface or the command line, the positivity interval must be a positive
integer.

<P><A HREF="#Parameters">Return to the list of parameters</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="BackprojectionWeight">Backprojection Weight</A></H2>
<P>For the backprojection reconstruction algorithm, there are five available
choices for how to filter the projections to compensate for the fact that
an average of the backprojected measurements without filtering will
overemphasize the low frequency components from the measurements.  Those
choices are:

<DL>
    <DT>none<DD>With this option, the projection data is not filtered.
      Therefore there is no compensation for the unequal sampling in frequency
      space for the reconstruction and no adjustment for the intensities such
      that projections of the reconstruction have a range of intensities
      similar to the original projection data.
    <DT>elliptical<DD>Can be used with any set of tilt angles and ensures that
      the projections of the reconstruction have similar intensities to the
      original projection data.  The values for the
      <A HREF="#BackprojectionParticleSize">particle size</A> affect this
      weighting function.  You may also use the
      <A HREF="#BackprojectionHamming">option to apply a Hamming filter</A> to
      the projections in conjunction with this weighting function.
    <DT>elliptical-square<DD>Can be used with any set of tilt angles and
      ensures that the projections of the reconstruction have similar
      intensities to the original projection data.  The values for the
      <A HREF="#BackprojectionParticleSize">particle size</A> affect this
      weighting function.  You may also use the
      <A HREF="#BackprojectionHamming">option to apply a Hamming filter</A> to
      the projections in conjunction with this weighting function.
    <DT>r*<DD>This filtering option assumes that the tilt angles are evenly
      spaced.  Also, the projections of the reconstruction will have a
      different range of intensities than the original projections.  You may
      use the
      <A HREF="#BackprojectionHamming">option to apply a Hamming filter</A> to
      the projections in conjunction with this weighting function.
    <DT>r* with Hamming<DD>This filtering option is the same as the r*
      filter except that it includes a Hamming filter applied to the
      projections as well.  If you want to filter the projections twice
      with a Hamming filter, you can use the
      <A HREF="#BackprojectionHamming">"Backprojection Hamming" option</A>
      as well.
</DL>

<P><A HREF="#Parameters">Return to the list of parameters</A>

<H2><A NAME="BackprojectionHamming">Backprojection Hamming</A></H2>
<P>If you use the <A HREF="#Method">backprojection reconstruction method</A>
and use a <A HREF="#BackprojectionWeight">weighting function</A> different
than "none", then you may specify that a Hamming filter (a one-dimensional
local smoothing filter) be applied to the projections as well prior to the
backprojection.  To turn on the Hamming filter from the graphical user
interface, turn on the "Backprojection Hamming" toggle button in the special
parameters dialog.

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="BackprojectionParticleSize">Particle Size</A></H2>
<P>If you use the <A HREF="#Method">backprojection reconstruction method</A>
with the elliptical or elliptical square weighting function, the weighting
function uses the particle size to account for the approximate spatial bounds
of the object to reconstruct.  The first particle size parameter is the extent
in x, and the second particle size parameter and the second is the extent in z.
Both have units of pixels.  By default, the particle size parameters are set to
the same size as the reconstruction bounds.

<P><A HREF="#Parameters">Return to the list of parameters</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Resolution">Resolution</A></H2>
<P>The resolution parameter selects which resolution to process from the
input tilt series.  Normally, the tilt series has been preprocessed with
<A HREF="APPL_PRM.html">apply parameters</A>, and the highest resolution
in the tilt series corresponds to the resolution you want.  In those
situations, you would set the resolution parameter to zero (the default value)
to select the highest resolution from the tilt series.

<P>On the command line, use
<PRE>
    <CODE>-res=</CODE><VAR>i</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>to have the reconstruction use the <VAR>i</VAR>th resolution from the
tilt series.  When run from the command line and no resolution is selected,
the reconstruction will use the highest resolution present in the input tilt
series.

<P><A HREF="#Parameters">Return to the list of parameters</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="ResolutionScale">Resolution Scale</A></H2>
<P>The resolution scale parameter controls the scale factor applied to the
reconstruction size parameters.  In the typical case where you select a
resolution level to process from the main dialog of
<A HREF="EMTAR.html">EMTAR</A>, the graphical interface will automatically fill
in the resolution scale correctly.  In the case where you are running the
reconstruction directly on a downsampled tilt series but still specify the
reconstruction size in terms of the full resolution, you should set the
resolution scale to be the same as the downsampling factor (if the data is
scaled down by a factor of four set the resolution scale parameter to four).

<P>On the command line, use
<PRE>
    <CODE>-rscale=</CODE><VAR>i</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>to set the resolution scale to be <VAR>i</VAR>.  When run from the
command line without the -rscale option, GPURECON will use a scale factor
equal to two raised to the power of the
<A HREF="#Resolution">resolution level</A> selected with -res.

<H2><A NAME="Multires">Add Multires</A></H2>
<P>Turn on the "Add multires" toggle button to cause GPURECON to add lower
resolutions to the reconstruction if the x and y dimensions of the
reconstruction are large enough.  Turn off the "Add multires" toggle button to
cause GPURECON to generate a reconstruction with a single resolution.

<P>On the command line, include
<PRE>
    <CODE>-multires</CODE>
</PRE>
<P>in the command-line options for GPURECON to cause GPURECON to add lower
resolutions to the reconstruction if the x and y dimensions of the
reconstruction are large enough.

<H2><A NAME="GuessResolution">Guess Resolution</A></H2>
<P>The guess resolution parameter allows you to select which resolution
to use from the <A HREF="#InitialGuess">file containing the initial guess</A>.
The dimensions of the resolution you select must be compatible with the
