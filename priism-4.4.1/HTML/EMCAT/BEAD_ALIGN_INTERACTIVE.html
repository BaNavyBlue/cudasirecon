<H1><A NAME="BEAD_ALIGN">Interactive BEAD_ALIGN</A></H1>
<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>BEAD_ALIGN, in either its automatic or interactive versions, is the
last step in the alignment process.  The interactive mode of BEAD_ALIGN
provides a platform to solve "in vivo" any potential problems in bead
alignment.  There are three dialogs that are used when working with interactive
BEAD_ALIGN:
<UL>
<LI>The first is the <A HREF="BALIGN.html">main control dialog</A> for the
  alignment process.  From it, you set the input parameters and start
  BEAD_ALIGN.  The input parameters are the same for the interactive and
  automatic versions of BEAD_ALIGN, except for
  <A HREF="BEAD_ALIGN.html#dMax2">dMax2</A> which is not used by the
  interactive version.  For more information about the input parameters
  consult <A HREF="BEAD_ALIGN.html">BEAD_ALIGN.html</A>.
<LI>The second dialog is displayed after interactive BEAD_ALIGN was launched
  and the initial round of least-squares fitting was completed.  This dialog
  has a bar chart display of the difference between the fit and the input
  positions for each bead and projection.  It also has controls to start
  additional rounds of fitting and to limit which beads are included in the
  fit.
<LI>The third is an image window for the data stack.  From the second
  dialog, set the <A HREF="#Image">Image toggle</A> on to attach to this
  window if it is already open or to create it.  The input and fitted
  bead positions will be overlayed on the image data.  Using the mouse,
  you can add, delete, or change the input bead positions for the next
  round of fitting.
</UL>

<P>The advantages of the interactive version of BEAD_ALIGN over the automatic
one are:

<UL>
  <LI>You're provided with graphical feedback about the results of the fit,
    and can use that information to adjust the input bead locations or
    exclusion thresholds without restarting the program.
  <LI>You can edit the input bead list and refit; this is somewhat easier
    than using <A HREF="PEdit.html">the bead list editor</A> to make the
    changes and then running the automatic version of BEAD_ALIGN.
  <LI>You have more control over which beads are included in the fit, i.e.
    you can exclude any bead from the fit, which can not be done with
    the automatic version unless a new input bead list is created.
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="Fitting">Fitting</A></H2>
<P>There are four steps in each round of fitting:
<OL>
  <LI>If this is the first round of fitting (BEAD_ALIGN was just
    started or the <A HREF="#Restart">Restart</A> button was pressed),
    an initial guess for the fit parameters is calculated.  This
    is done by setting the in-plane rotation angles to the linear
    function set with the <A HREF="BEAD_ALIGN.html#rot0">rot0 input
    parameter</A>, setting the magnification to one for all the projections,
    and estimating the image shifts by looking for beads common to
    nearby sections.  This process can fail if there are insufficient
    common beads between a section and its neighbors or if there aren't
    a sufficient number of beads on the
    <A HREF="BEAD_ALIGN.html#*iRef">reference section</A>.  If the
    initialization fails and the program was just started, it will quit,
    and you'll need to use the <A HREF="PEdit.html">bead list editor</A>
    to add more bead locations (in some instances you may be able to resolve
    the problem by increasing the <A HREF="BEAD_ALIGN.html#*nSkip">nSkip</A>
    input parameter.  If it fails after the <A HREF="#Restart">Restart</A>
    button was used, you'll be left with the result of the previous fit,
    and should add more bead positions (see
    <A HREF="#BeadDisplay">Bead display</A> for details).
  <LI>If the first step wasn't performed (i.e. have the results of a
    previous round of fitting to use), then the bead list is scanned to
    find those locations that match the criteria for exclusion from the fit:
    <UL>
      <LI>Any bead which has been toggled off in the interactive BEAD_ALIGN
        dialog is not used in the fit.
      <LI>Any input location that is more than <A HREF="#thPuri">thPuri</A>
        pixels from the fit location is not included in the fit
      <LI>Any bead which has more than a given number of locations rejected
        by the distance criteria is excluded from the fit.  The threshold
        for the number of locations is set by the
        <A HREF="BEAD_ALIGN.html#dMax1">dMax1</A> option when the program is
        started.  It can not be changed without restarting the program.
      <LI>Any bead that appears in fewer than a given number of projections
        is excluded.  This limit is also set by the
        <A HREF="BEAD_ALIGN.html#dMax1">dMax1</A> option and can not be
        changed after the program is started.
    </UL>
  <LI>The positions available for fitting are then examined to verify that
    there are a sufficient number of data points to determine the
    alignment parameters.  If there are not (one reason why this would
    be the case is that there were fewer than four beads that were fit
    on any one section), the fitting process will terminate and either
    the initial guess from the first step or the last fit result will
    be reported.  To obtain a successful fit, you'll either have to
    relax the criteria for excluding bead positions (increasing
    <A HREF="#thPuri">thPuri</A> is the typical way to do this) or add
    more bead positions (see <A HREF="#BeadDisplay">Bead display</A> for
    details).
  <LI>The final step is to do the least-squares fit of the selected bead
    positions.  On rare occasions this can fail, and the result will be the
    last estimate of the alignment parameters.  One cause of failure is
    that the maximum number of iterations (set by the
    <A HREF="BEAD_ALIGN.html#*cycles">cycles input option</A>) was exceeded.
    A possible solution is to do another round of fitting; it may be that the
    initial guess was sufficiently far from the best fit that a large number of
    iterations was needed.  In other cases, the combination of the input
    bead list and the starting values for the alignment parameters is not
    allowing the algorithm to converge.  If it wasn't the first round of
    fitting, you might try the <A HREF="#Restart">Restart button</A> to see
    what happens with a different initial guess for the alignment parameters.
    Otherwise, you'll want to check the input bead list and correct any
    inconsistencies.

<H2><A NAME="BeadDisplay">Bead display</A></H2>
<P>Information about the bead positions and the positions resulting from
the fit of the alignment parameters is displayed in a bar chart form, and
when enabled with the <A HREF="#Image">Image toggle</A> the positions are
overlayed on the image data from the data stack.

<P>The bar chart displays the difference (in pixels) between the input
position for a bead and the result from fitting the alignment parameters.
The positions for a single bead are shown on a single row in the chart;
the bead locations on one section appear in a single column on the chart.

<P>If a bead is not present in a section, no bar is shown in the corresponding
chart entry.  A full-height bar in the chart is equivalent to a distance of
<A HREF="#thDisp">thDisp</A> pixels; differences larger than the maximum
value are just shown as the maximum value.  The amount by which any
difference exceeds the distance threshold, <A HREF="#thPuri">thPuri</A>,
for excluding a bead from the next round of fitting is shown in red.  If
<A HREF="#thPuri">thPuri</A> is greater than the maximum distance shown,
the red portion will not be visible; its good practice to set the maximum
distance shown larger than the exclusion threshold.

<P>Along the top of the chart, the tilt angle for each section and the index
of each section is shown above the column corresponding to that column.
The index of every tenth section is highlighted in a light blue.  At the
bottom of the chart, the index of the section and the number of bead positions
on the section which are below the exclusion threshold are shown.  Any
section where the number of beads below the threshold is less than the minimum
needed for fitting is highlighted in red.  Any section where the bead positions
have been edited since the last round of fitting is highlighted in purple.

<P>With the mouse, there are three actions you can perform with elements of
the bar chart.  The toggles on the left hand side of the chart control
whether or not a bead is included in the next round of fitting.  When
the <A HREF="#Image">Image toggle</A> is on, clicking the left mouse button
while the cursor is over a bar will cause the image window to display the
section and circle the bead position for that bar.  When the mouse button
is over one of the number of bead position for fitting at the bottom of the
chart, clicking with the left mouse button will cause the image display
window to display that section.

<P>In the image display window, the fitted positions of the beads are shown
with green Xs.  The fitted positions are labeled by the bead number.  The
significance of the color of the label is:
<DL>
  <DT>red
  <DD>This bead will be used in the next round of fitting (set by the
    toggles to the right of the bar chart), and it has a position on this
    section recorded in the input bead list.

  <DT>green
  <DD>This bead will be used in the next round of fitting, but no position
    for this section is available in the input bead list.

  <DT>pink
  <DD>This bead will not be used in the next round of fitting.  The
    input bead list has a position for this bead on this section.

  <DT>blue
  <DD>This bead will not be used in the next round of fitting.  The
    input bead list does not have a position for this bead on this section.
</DL>

<P>When the image window has the bead position overlayed on it, you can
edit the positions of the beads with the mouse.  To move a position which
is present in the input bead list (i.e. shown as a red X), make sure the
<A HREF="#delBPos">del BPos toggle</A> (delete position toggle) is off in
the interactive BEAD_ALIGN dialog, position the cursor over the bead
location to be moved, depress and hold the left mouse button while moving
the cursor to the desired location, and then release the left mouse button.
The procedure for adding a position which is not present in the input bead
list is similar:  make sure the delete position toggle is off, position the
mouse over the fitted location of the bead (marked with a green X), depress
and hold the the left mouse button while moving the cursor to the desired
location, and release the mouse button.  To remove a position present in
the input bead list, make sure the delete position toggle is on, position
the cursor over the input position (red X) to be removed, and click the
left mouse button.

<P>This is the typical procedure used with interactive BEAD_ALIGN:
<OL>
<LI>Set the input parameters in the <A HREF="BALIGN.html">main alignment
  dialog</A>.  The input parameters are described in
  <A HREF="BEAD_ALIGN.html">BEAD_ALIGN.html</A>.
<LI>Select the interactive mode for BEAD_ALIGN in the main alignment dialog
  (i.e. the <A HREF="BALIGN.html#interactive">interactive toggle</A> is on)
  and turn on BEAD_ALIGN (the toggle to the left of the <EM>BEAD_ALIGN</EM>
  button.  Then press the <EM>DoIt</EM> button to start interactive BEAD_ALIGN.
<LI>Examine the results in the bar chart display.  Each bar represents the
  distance between an input position and the fit result.  A full-height bar
  represents a distance of <A HREF="#thDisp">thDisp</A> pixels, and
  larger distances are just shown as the maximum distance.  If a position
  is not present in  the input, no bar will be shown.  The bead positions
  which would be excluded from the next round of fitting based on the
  distance threshold, <A HREF="#thPuri">thPuri</A>, will have part of their
  bar displayed in red (if <A HREF="#thPuri">thPuri</A> is greater than or
  equal to <A HREF="#thDisp">thDisp</A>, this red part will not be visible;
  you'll want to set <A HREF="#thDisp">thDisp</A> to be more than the
  exclusion threshold).  The number of non-excluded bead positions is
  on each section is shown at the bottom of the bar chart; for sections where
  it is less than four (the minimum needed), the number is highlighted in
  red.
<LI>If the errors in the fit are excessive (a rule of thumb is that they
  should be less than one pixel), adjust bead positions and the exclusion
  threshold, <A HREF="#thPuri">thPuri</A> for the next round of fitting.
  Editing of the bead list is described in more detail in
  <A HREF="#BeadDisplay">Bead display</A>.  At a minimum, you'll need to
  make sufficient adjustments so that no sections have fewer than four
  bead locations that will be fit.
<LI>If you want another round of fitting and the thresholds and positions
  have been adjusted, press the <A HREF="#Fit">Fit button</A> to start
  from the current estimates of the alignment parameters.  The
  <A HREF="#Restart">Restart button</A> will also start another round of
  fitting, but it does not use the current estimates for the alignment
  parameters as its starting point and it does not exclude bead positions
  based on the distance threshold.  It is useful if you can not set a
  reasonable threshold for <A HREF="#thPuri">thPuri</A> and have enough
  beads locations on each section of if starting from the current alignment
  estimates does not cause the fit algorithm to converge appropriately.
<LI>Repeat steps three through five until you are satisfied with the errors
  in the fit.    At any point you can use the <A HREF="#Save">"Save" button</A>
  to record the current alignment parameters and bead positions.  Use the
  <A HREF="#Exit">"Exit" button</A> to quit.

<P>When this toggle is on, the bead positions from the input list and the
result of fitting the alignment parameters are displayed in the input
window whose number is shown in the <A HREF="#Window">Window field</A>.
<A HREF="#BeadDisplay">Bead display</A> has a description of the coloring
scheme used and how to edit the bead positions with the mouse.

<P>When this toggle is off, the bead positions are not displayed in an
image window.  When you turn the toggle on, the program will connect to
an existing window which displays the data stack (it does this by looking
for it by name; the name it uses is specified by the
<A HREF="BEAD_ALIGN.html#IdatFile">IdatFile</A>); if the data stack has
not been loaded into an image window, you'll be presented with a dialog to

<H2><A NAME="thDisp">thDisp Field</A></H2>
<P>This field shows the distance in pixels that corresponds to a full-height
bar in the bar chart display.  For bead positions where the distance between
the input bead position and the fitted position exceeds this value, a
full-height bar is used.  After each round of fitting, the distance
corresponding to a full-height bar is reset to two times the average distance
between input and fitted bead positions.

<P><A HREF="#InterfaceItems">Return to the list of interface items</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="thPuri">thPuri Field</A></H2>
<P>The value shown in this field is the distance threshold for using a
bead position in the next round of fitting; positions where the input
bead position and the previous fit result are separated by more than this
number of pixels are not included in the fit.  Such bead positions will
have the upper part of their bars in the bar chart painted red (the red
part will only be visible if <A HREF="#thDisp">thDisp</A> is larger than
the distance threshold).

<P>An appropriate value for the distance threshold should be chosen before
starting the next round of fitting.  If there are not enough beads (fewer than
four) on a section which do not exceed the threshold, there will be
insufficient data to perform the fit.  All sections where this condition holds
are flagged with a red entry on the <EM>nb</EM> line at the bottom of the
bar chart.  You can either choose a more generous distance threshold or
edit bead positions to remedy the problem.

about the fitting process, see <A HREF="#Fitting">Fitting</A>.

<P>Once the fit completes successfully, the bar chart and
<A HREF="#thDisp">thDisp</A> level will be updated to reflect the new
differences between the input positions and the fit results.  A *.out
file (the name is set by the <A HREF="BEAD_ALIGN.html#OdocFile">OdocFile</A>
argument when the program is started) will have a record of the initial
and final alignment parameters for the fit, 3D bead locations, sum of the
squares of the differences between the fit and the input data, and the
input and fitted positions for the beads in each section.

<H2><A NAME="Restart">Restart</A></H2>
<P>This button can be used to do another round of fitting just as the
<A HREF="#Fit">Fit button</A> does, but it is different in two important
ways:

<UL>
  <LI>Beads are not excluded from the fit based on the distance from the
    input bead position to the position based on the initial estimate
    of the alignment parameters.  The toggles next to the bar chart for
    excluding a bead from the fit are also ignored.
  <LI>The starting point for the fit is not the most recent fit results
    for the alignment parameters, but a calculated guess
    (<A HREF="#Fitting">the section on fitting</A> has some information on
    how this guess is obtained).
</UL>

<P>Using <EM>Restart</EM> rather than <EM>Fit</EM> is useful when the
previous round of fitting failed leaving you in a situation where you
can not set a reasonable distance threshold, <A HREF="#thPuri">thPuri</A>,
or the fit algorithm is unable to progress from the initial conditions
left by the last round of fitting.
