# Lists color lookup tables that will appear in Priism's
# Color->Change Lookup Table menu.  Lines whose first
# character is a # or which only contain whitespace are
# ignored.  Other lines should have the format
#
# "name" "short_name" "path"
#
# or
#
# "name" "short_name" "path" options
#
# name should be the name of the color table as it will
# appear in the menu.  short_name is a name for the color
# table appropriate for use from the command line.  path
# is the path to the file describing the lookup table.  Paths
# that do not begin with / are interpreted relative to the
# COLORS directory of the Priism distribution.  Currently
# support two file formats for lookup tables:
#
# 1) The ASCII format MayaVi uses
#     A header line has LOOKUP_TABLE followed by white space
#     followed by the table name with no embedded whitespace
#     followed by the number of table entries.  Each entry
#     in the color table has red, green, blue, and alpha
#     components (in that order), and each component is a
#     floating point value in the range [0, 1].
#
# 2) The binary PAL format
#     The file has 768 bytes of data.  The first 256 bytes hold
#     the red components, the second 256 bytes hold the green
#     components, and the final 256 bytes hold the blue
#     components.  Each component is stored as an unsigned
#     8-bit integer.
#
# options can can contain one or more of the following separated
# by semicolons:
#
# reverse
#     Reverse the order of the color table entries when used
#     in Priism.  Reversing the order occurs before adjustments
#     to the table to account for a mismatch in table size.
#
# scale
#     If the color table is a fixed size color table and its
#     size is less than the size needed, Priism will linearly
#     interpolate or skip elements so the table sizes match.
#     By default, Priism will not include a color table in the
#     the menu if its size does not match the size needed.
#
# shift
#     If the color table is a fixed size color table and its
#     size is larger than the size needed, Priism will not
#     use elements from start of the table so the table
#     sizes match.
#
# skip
#     If the color table is a fixed size color table and its
#     size is larger than the size needed, Priism will skip
#     roughly evenly spaced elements so the table sizes match.
#
# truncate
#     If the color table is a fixed size color table and its
#     size is larger than the size needed, Priism will not
#     use elements from the end of the table so the table
#     sizes match.
#
# If options conflict, the one that appears first has precedence.
# Priism scans the contents of the LUT.def in Priism's CONFIG
# directory first.  It then scans the LUT.def, if any, in
# the .iveprefs subdirectory of the user's home directory.
