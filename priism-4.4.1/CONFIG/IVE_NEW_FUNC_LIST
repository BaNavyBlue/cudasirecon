#    This file contain a list of IVE programs on the system. It will be read
#    into IVE kernel when it is initialized in the beginning. The file
#    describes how the programs will be presented in a cascade of nested pulldowns.
#    The pulldowns can go to as many levels as needed and the last pulldown
#    will be the help pulldown consisting of all the programs in the previous
#    pulldowns and in the same category structure. The format required is:
#    1) text after a # on a line is ignored
#    2) blank lines are ignored
#    3) start each pulldown at the top with:    start pulldown "label" 
#    4) add all the elements that will be in the pulldown and then end
#     the pulldown with: end pulldown. Indentation can be used for readability.
#     Types of lines that can be in a pulldown:
#      a. start submenu "label"  - this describes the label of an element of
#       the pulldown that will have a pullright menu off of it. Submenus can
#       be inside other submenus for as many levels as you want. When all the
#       elements have been added for a submenu, end it with: end submenu.
#      b. The following format will describe one program to be selected from
#        any level of the pulldown menus: 
#        path   "program label"  "help root"
#        path - Gives the name of the executable to run.  If it begins with
#         a /, the name is not modified; otherwise, the path to the
#         directory for executables in the Priism directory tree is prepended
#         to the name.  The environment variable IVE_BASE is assumed to point
#         the root of the Priism directory tree.
#        program label - this must be in quotes since it can be more than one
#         word long. this is just the label for the program on the pulldown. 
#        help root - the root of the help file name. the root only is
#         given so that either .html or .hlp will be used depending on
#         the IVE_HELP environmental variable. Help root can include a
#         keyword if desired.  If a file name begins with a /, nothing
#         is added to the beginning of the name when searching for the
#         help file; otherwise the name of the IVE directory containing
#         the help files in html or old text format is prepended to the
#         name.
#      c. insert separator
#        Inserts a separator (horizontal line) into the menu.
