# Lists plugins for converting images captured by ImageCapture and 3DModel.
# Lines whose first character is a # are ignored.  Other non-empty lines
# should have the format
#
# "format_name" "short_name" "plugin_path"
#
# or
#
# "format_name" "short_name" "plugin_path" "interface_name"
#
# format_name should be replaced with the name of the alternate format;
# this name is used in user interface controls.  short_name should be
# replaced with a short name (suitable for identifying the format on the
# command line) for the alternate format.  The plugin_path should be
# replaced with the path name of the plugin; if the path does not start with
# /, the path is interpreted relative to the Priism bin directory for the
# system.  interface_name should be replaced with the name of the plugin
# interface that supports a specific format; this is useful when a plugin
# can handle multiple formats.
#
# The capture_plugins.def file, if any, in the .iveprefs subdirectory of the
# user's home directory is scanned first.  Then the capture_plugins.def file
# in Priism's CONFIG directory is scanned.
