# Lists alternate rendering plugins for Volume Viewer.  Volume Viewer
# ignores lines whose first character is #.  Volume Viewer interprets other
# non-empty lines as the path names for plugins to load.  If the path name
# does not start with a /, Volume Viewer treats the path as relative to the
# Priism bin directory for the system.  By default, Volume Viewer uses the
# first plugin that it loads successfully and uses an internal software
# renderer if it could not load a plugin.  You can force Volume Viewer to use
# a particular plugin by passing Volume Viewer a -plugin=name option on the
# command line where name is the full path name of the plugin or an empty
# string (which forces the use of the internal renderer).
#
# Volume Viewer first scans a volview_plugins.def file, if any, in the
# .iveprefs subdirectory of the user's home directory.  It then scans
# the volview_plugins.def file in the Priism CONFIG directory.
