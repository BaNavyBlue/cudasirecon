#    This file specifies a list of IVE programs on the system that will
#    be directly invokeable from the monitor.  It will be read
#    in when the first monitor (monitor 0) is started.  The file
#    describes how the programs will be presented in a cascade of nested
#    pulldowns.  The pulldowns can go to as many levels as needed.  The
#    monitor window has three pulldowns that are always present, "File",
#    "Image", "Options", and "Help" (in that order).
#
#    The format required in this file is:
#      1) text after a # on a line is ignored
#      2) blank lines are ignored
#      3) start each pulldown at the top with:    start pulldown "label" 
#      4) add all the elements that will be in the pulldown and then end
#         the pulldown with: end pulldown. Indentation can be used for
#         readability.  Types of lines that can be in a pulldown:
#         a. start submenu "label"
#            This describes the label of an element of the pulldown that will
#            have a pullright menu off of it. Submenus can be inside other
#            submenus for as many levels as you want.  When all the elements
#            have been added for a submenu, end it with: end submenu.
#         b. end submenu
#            Ends a submenu started with start submenu.
#         c. path   "program label"  "help root"
#            Specifies one program to be entered in the current submenu.
#            path - Gives the name of the executable to run.  If it begins with
#              a /, the name is not modified; otherwise, the path to the
#              directory for executables in the Priism directory tree is
#              prepended to the name.  The environment variable IVE_BASE is
#              assumed to point the root of the Priism directory tree.
#            program label - this must be in quotes since it can be more
#              than one word long. this is just the label for the program in
#              the pulldown. 
#            help root - the root of the help file name. the root only is
#              given so that either .html or .hlp will be used depending on
#              the IVE_HELP environmental variable. Help root can include a
#              keyword if desired.  If a file name begins with a /, nothing
#              is added to the beginning of the name when searching for the
#              help file; otherwise the name of the IVE directory containing
#              the help files in html or old text format is prepended to the
#              name.
#         d. insert separator
#            Inserts a separator (horizontal line) into the menu.
