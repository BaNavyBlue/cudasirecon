# Defines association between lens number and CTF file name.  Used by the
# deconvolution graphical interface to automatically select a CTF based
# on the lens number.  An individual user may override these settings by
# creating a CTF.def file in the .iveprefs subdirectory of the user's
# home directory.
#
# The format is (optional parts are listed in brackets):
#     [whitespace] lens_number whitespace "ctf_filename"
# lens_number may be an integer value or default; the latter sets the
# CTF to use if there is not a match for the lens number of the data.
# Comments, which begin with #, and blank lines (containing only whitespace)
# are allowed.
